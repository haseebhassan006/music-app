Vasari to study drama at the age of seventeen. He became a dancer, and during this time he married his first wife, and they had a son together,[6] named Joseph Neville Goddard.[7] While touring with his dance company in England he developed an interest in metaphysics after striking up a conversation with a Scotsman who lent him a series of books on the powers of the mind. Upon his return to New York he gave up the entertainment industry to devote his full attention to the study of spiritualand mystical matters.\n\nNeville Goddard’s first marriage was short lived, and he remained single for years until in the 1930s he met his second wife, who was a designer.[6] After they married, they had a daughter named Victoria or “Vicky”.[8] In 1943, he was drafted into the U.S. Army at age 38,[9] which he did not want, especially since he felt he was too old to become a soldier and had a wife and daughter at home to take care of. Through the power of imagination, as Neville told it in his March 24, 1972 lecture,[9] he was honorably discharged after just a few weeks of training. One consequence of his brief Army training was that he received full United States citizenship, having been a British citizen up to this point.[9]\n\nAbdullah – Neville Goddard’s Teacher\n\nGoddard’s interest in esoteric interpretations of the Bible deepened after he met Abdullah, an Ethopian Jew who lectured on Esoteric Christianity and taught both Goddard and Joseph Murphy. Neville went to hear him somewhat under protest to satisfy the constant urging of a friend, saying “I recall the first night I met Abdullah. I had purposely delayed going to one of his meetings because a man whose judgement I did not trust had insisted on my attendance. At the end of the meeting, Ab approached me and said: ‘Neville, you are six months late.’ Startled, I questioned how he knew my name, when he said: ‘The brothers told me you would be here six months ago.’ Then he added: ‘I will remain until you have received all that I must give you. Then I will depart.’ He, too, may have longed to go, but he had to wait for me.”[10][11] From this introduction, Neville studied with Abdullah learning Hebrew, the Kabbalah, and the hidden symbolic meaning of Scripture.[12]\n\nNeville Goddard’s Lectures\n\nAfter traveling extensively throughout the United States, Neville eventually made his home in Los Angeles where, in the 1950s, he gave a series of talks on television and radio, and for many years lectured regularly to capacity audiences at the Wilshire Ebell Theater.[13] In the 1960s and early 1970s, he confined most of his lectures to Los Angeles, New York, and San Francisco.\n\nIn his early lectures and books Neville dealt solely with what he called The Law, the technique of creating one’s physical reality through imagining. It is this portion of his expression that most closely accords with the teachings of the New Thought movement. In describing The Law, Neville related how he made a sea voyage from New York to see his family in Barbados during theDepression, without any money of his own.[14]','Neville Goddard',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,1,0,1,0,'2021-07-15 14:44:53','2021-07-27 23:29:06'),(6,'11,12',NULL,'Theodor W. Adorno (/əˈdɔːrnoʊ/;[8] German: [ˈteːodoːɐ̯ ʔaˈdɔɐ̯no];[9][10] born Theodor Ludwig Wiesengrund; September 11, 1903 – August 6, 1969) was a German philosopher, sociologist, psychologist, musicologist, and composer known for his critical theory of society.\n\nHe was a leading member of the Frankfurt School of critical theory, whose work has come to be associated with thinkers such as Ernst Bloch, Walter Benjamin, Max Horkheimer, Erich Fromm, and Herbert Marcuse, for whom the works of Freud, Marx, and Hegel were essential to a critique of modern society. As a critic of both fascism and what he called the culture industry, his writings—such as Dialectic of Enlightenment (1947), Minima Moralia (1951) and Negative Dialectics (1966)—strongly influenced the European New Left.\n\nAmidst the vogue enjoyed by existentialism and positivism in early 20th-century Europe, Adorno advanced a dialectical conception of natural history that critiqued the twin temptations of ontology and empiricism through studies of Kierkegaard and Husserl. As a classically trained pianist whose sympathies with the twelve-tone technique of Arnold Schoenberg resulted in his studying composition with Alban Berg of the Second Viennese School, Adorno\'s commitment to avant-garde music formed the backdrop of his subsequent writings and led to his collaboration with Thomas Mann on the latter\'s novel Doctor Faustus, while the two men lived in California as exiles during the Second World War. Working for the newly relocated Institute for Social Research, Adorno collaborated on influential studies of authoritarianism, antisemitism and propaganda that would later serve as models for sociological studies the Institute carried out in post-war Germany.\n\nUpon his return to Frankfurt, Adorno was involved with the reconstitution of German intellectual life through debates with Karl Popper on the limitations of positivist science, critiques of Heidegger\'s language of authenticity, writings on German responsibility for the Holocaust, and continued interventions into matters of public policy. As a writer of polemics in the tradition of Nietzsche and Karl Kraus, Adorno delivered scathing critiques of contemporary Western culture. Adorno\'s posthumously published Aesthetic Theory, which he planned to dedicate to Samuel Beckett, is the culmination of a lifelong commitment to modern art which attempts to revoke the \"fatal separation\" of feeling and understanding long demanded by the history of philosophy and explode the privilege aesthetics accords to content over form and contemplation over immersion.','Theodor W.

His best-known work, As a Man Thinketh, has been mass-produced since its publication in 1903. It has been a source of inspiration to motivational and self-help authors. Born in Leicester, England, into a working-class family, Allen was the elder of two brothers. His mother could neither read nor write. His father, William, was a factory knitter. In 1879, following a downturn in the textile trade of central England, Allen\'s father travelled alone to America to find work and establish a new home for the family. Within two days of arriving his father was pronounced dead at New York City Hospital, believed to be a case of robbery and murder. At age fifteen, with the family now facing economic disaster, Allen was forced to leave school and find work.\n\nFor much of the 1890s, Allen worked as a private secretary and stationer in several British manufacturing firms. In 1893 Allen moved to London and later to South Wales, earning his living by journalism and reporting. In South Wales he met Lily Louisa Oram (Lily L. Allen) whom he then wed in 1895. In 1898 Allen found an occupation in which he could showcase his spiritual and social interests as a writer for the magazine, The Herald of the Golden Age. At this time, Allen entered a creative period where he then published his first of many books, From Poverty to Power (1901). In 1902 Allen began to publish his own spiritual magazine, The Light of Reason, later retitled The Epoch.\n\nIn 1903, Allen published his third and most famous book As a Man Thinketh. Loosely based on the biblical passage of Proverbs 23:7, \"As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he,\" the small work eventually became read around the world and brought Allen posthumous fame as one of the pioneering figures of modern inspirational thought. The book\'s minor audience allowed Allen to quit his secretarial work and pursue his writing and editing career. In 1903, the Allen family retired to the town of Ilfracombe where Allen would spend the rest of his life. Continuing to publish the Epoch, Allen produced more than one book per year until his death in 1912. There he wrote for nine years, producing 19 works.\n\nFollowing his death in 1912, his wife continued publishing the magazine under the name The Epoch. Lily Allen summarised her husband\'s literary mission in the preface to one of his posthumously published manuscripts, Foundation Stones to Happiness and Success saying:\n\n\"He never wrote theories, or for the sake of writing; but he wrote when he had a message, and it became a message only when he had lived it out in his own life, and knew that it was good. Thus he wrote facts, which he had proven by practice.\"[1]\n\nJames Allen is still relevant today. His book \"As a Man Thinketh\" was converted into an audiobook entitled \"As A Woman Thinketh\" in 2015.

and attributes not shared with either animal or machine? The definition of “human” is circular: we are human by virtue of the properties that make us human (i.e., distinct from animal and machine). It is a definition by negation: that which separates us from animal and machine is our “human-ness”.\n\nWe are human because we are not animal, nor machine. But such thinking has been rendered progressively less tenable by the advent of evolutionary and neo-evolutionary theories which postulate a continuum in nature between animals and Man.\n\nOur uniqueness is partly quantitative and partly qualitative. Many animals are capable of cognitively manipulating symbols and using tools. Few are as adept at it as we are. These are easily quantifiable differences – two of many.\n\nQualitative differences are a lot more difficult to substantiate. In the absence of privileged access to the animal mind, we cannot and don’t know if animals feel guilt, for instance. Do animals love? Do they have a concept of sin? What about object permanence, meaning, reasoning, self-awareness, critical thinking? Individuality? Emotions? Empathy? Is artificial intelligence (AI) an oxymoron? A machine that passes the Turing Test may well be described as “human”. But is it really? And if it is not – why isn’t it?\n\nLiterature is full of stories of monsters – Frankenstein, the Golem – and androids or anthropoids. Their behaviour is more “humane” than the humans around them. This, perhaps, is what really sets humans apart: their behavioural unpredictability. It is yielded by the interaction between Mankind’s underlying immutable genetically-determined nature – and Man’s kaleidoscopically changing environments.\n\nThe Constructivists even claim that Human Nature is a mere cultural artefact. Sociobiologists, on the other hand, are determinists. They believe that human nature – being the inevitable and inexorable outcome of our bestial ancestry – cannot be the subject of moral judgment.\n\nAn improved Turing Test would look for baffling and erratic patterns of misbehaviour to identify humans. Pico della Mirandola wrote in “Oration on the Dignity of Man” that Man was born without a form and can mould and transform – actually, create – himself at will. Existence precedes essence, said the Existentialists centuries later.\n\nThe one defining human characteristic may be our awareness of our mortality. The automatically triggered, “fight or flight”, battle for survival is common to all living things (and to appropriately programmed machines). Not so the catalytic effects of imminent death. These are uniquely human. The appreciation of the fleeting translates into aesthetics, the uniqueness of our ephemeral life breeds morality, and the scarcity of time gives rise to ambition and creativity.\n\nIn an infinite life, everything materializes at one time or another, so the concept of choice is spurious. The realization of our finiteness forces us to choose among alternatives. This act of selection is predicated upon the existence of “free will”. Animals and machines are thought to be devoid of choice, slaves to their genetic or human programming.\n\nYet, all these answers to the question: “What does it mean to be human” – are lacking.\n\nThe set of attributes we designate as human is subject to profound alteration. Drugs, neuroscience, introspection, and experience all cause irreversible changes in these traits and characteristics. The accumulation of these changes can lead, in principle, to the emergence of new properties, or to the abolition of old ones.\n\nAnimals and machines are not supposed to possess free will or exercise it. What, then, about fusions of machines and humans (bionics)? At which point does a human turn into a machine? And why should we assume that free will ceases to exist at that – rather arbitrary – point?\n\nIntrospection – the ability to construct self-referential and recursive models of the world – is supposed to be a uniquely human quality. What about introspective machines? Surely, say the critics, such machines are PROGRAMMED to introspect, as opposed to humans. To qualify as introspection, it must be WILLED, they continue. Yet, if introspection is willed – WHO wills it? Self-willed introspection leads to infinite regression and formal logical paradoxes.\n\nMoreover, the notion – if not the formal concept – of “human” rests on many hidden assumptions and conventions.\n\nPolitical correctness notwithstanding – why presume that men and women (or different races) are identically human? Aristotle thought they were not. A lot separates males from females – genetically (both genotype and phenotype) and environmentally (culturally). What is common to these two sub-species that makes them both “human”?\n\nCan we conceive of a human without body (i.e., a Platonian Form, or soul)? Aristotle and Thomas Aquinas think not. A soul has no existence separate from the body. A machine-supported energy field with mental states similar to ours today – would it be considered human? What about someone in a state of coma – is he or she (or it) fully human?\n\nIs a new born baby human – or, at least, fully human – and, if so, in which sense? What about a future human race – whose features would be unrecognizable to us? Machine-based intelligence – would it be thought of as human? If yes, when would it be considered human?\n\nIn all these deliberations, we may be confusing “human” with “person”. The former is a private case of the latter. Locke’s person is a moral agent, a being responsible for its actions. It is constituted by the continuity of its mental states accessible to introspection.\n\nLocke’s is a functional definition. It readily accommodates non-human persons (machines, energy matrices) if the functional conditions are satisfied. Thus, an android which meets the prescribed requirements is more human than a brain dead person.\n\nDescartes’ objection that one cannot specify conditions of singularity and identity over time for disembodied souls is right only if we assume that such “souls” possess no energy. A bodiless intelligent energy matrix which maintains its form and identity over time is conceivable. Certain AI and genetic software programs already do it.\n\nStrawson is Cartesian and Kantian in his definition of a “person” as a “primitive”. Both the corporeal predicates and those pertaining to mental states apply equally, simultaneously, and inseparably to all the individuals of that type of entity. Human beings are one such entity. Some, like Wiggins, limit the list of possible persons to animals – but this is far from rigorously necessary and is unduly restrictive.\n\nThe truth is probably in a synthesis:\n\nA person is any type of fundamental and irreducible entity whose typical physical individuals (i.e., members) are capable of continuously experiencing a range of states of consciousness and permanently having a list of psychological attributes.\n\nThis definition allows for non-animal persons and recognizes the personhood of a brain damaged human (“capable of experiencing”). It also incorporates Locke’s view of humans as possessing an ontological status similar to “clubs” or “nations” – their personal identity consists of a variety of interconnected psychological continuities.',NULL,191,'4',0,0,12,'2021-07-28',NULL,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,'2021-07-28 06:29:34','2021-12-01 18:13:49'),(174,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0.00,'36','1','A Brief History Of Creation','What is the loop of Creation? How is there something from nothing?\n\nIn spite of the fact that it is impossible to prove that anything exists beyond one’s perception since any such proof would involve one’s perception (I observed it, I heard it, I thought about it, I calculated it, and etc.), science deals with a so-called objective reality “out there,” beyond one’s perception professing to describe Nature objectively (as if there was a Nature or reality external to one’s perception). The shocking impact of Matrix was precisely the valid possibility that what we believed to be reality was but our perception; however, this was presented through showing a real reality wherein the perceived reality was a computer simulation. Many who toy with the idea that perhaps, indeed, we are computer simulations, deviate towards questions, such as, who could create such software and what kind of hardware would be needed for such a feat. Although such questions assume that reality is our perception, they also axiomatically presuppose the existence of an objective deterministic world “out there” that nevertheless must be responsible for how we perceive our reality. This is a major mistake emphasizing technology and algorithms instead of trying to discover the nature of reality and the structure of creation. As will be shown in the following, the required paradigm shift from “perception is our reality fixed within an objective world,” to “perception is reality without the need of an objective world ‘out there,\'” is provided by a dynamic logical structure. The Holophanic loop logic is responsible for a consistent and complete worldview that not only describes, but also creates whatever can be perceived or experienced.\n\nStating that it is impossible to prove the existence of anything beyond one’s perception is not saying there is nothing beyond perception, only that if there is anything, then whatever that is, is indefinite. It could be argued that the existence of physical laws, the universal perception that the apple falls to the ground is proof of an objective reality. However, this universal agreement is also our perception. It could be argued that if we cannot decide what to perceive, and everybody perceives the same physical reality, then there must be some lawfulness that dictates how we perceive and therefore, this lawfulness could be external to our perception. However, this lawfulness, as we shall see later on, is the precise lawfulness that creates perception, the process of definition, which is not external to perception (this process creates the perceived and the perceiver, which then gives meaning to this process – a loop – but about that, later). It could be argued, that hitting our knee on the table – whether we believe in the table or not – will hurt. The table is external to our body, but not to our perception. What then is perception? It is relating, a process of definition, defining and thereby rendering meaningful what has been perceived.\n\nWhat then is this process of definition? It is creating borders within which one’s perception gains meaning. The word “definition” comes from the Latin de finire, meaning, making finite or limited. In Hebrew, definition is HAGDARA (הגדרה), meaning, to border. Any definition necessarily implies what the definition is not, or stated differently, to have meaning, whatever is defined explicitly includes the meaning by implicitly excluding everything else. Consequently, to define means to place the defined object within borders that by default create something beyond the borders of the definition. What is this something beyond the defined? The implicitly excluded everything else, or in other words, the indefinite. The paramount importance of incorporating the indefinite within a consistent logical structure cannot be overemphasized. The indefinite itself is a paradox, and incorporating it within the Holophanic logical structure engenders the loop of Creation where the dynamic structure of paradoxes is both the creative force of existence, and also the proof of the necessity of existence.\n\nTo better grasp the impetus of Creation, let’s look at the indefinite and paradoxes. What does “indefinite” mean? Anything as long as it is not specified (not defined); anything that appears both within and beyond the borders of the definition and thereby rendering the border superfluous, which means, no border, no definition. If nevertheless we would attempt to define the notion “indefinite,” then that’s a paradox because if we succeed, then it is defined, which contradicts its meaning – its indefiniteness – and the word “indefinite” means that it cannot be defined. This is an example of a paradox, that in essence means, if it is what it is, then it is not what it is, yet if it is not what it is, then it is what it is. A paradox is a creature that consists of a structure (how it is defined, the dynamic process on its way to stabilization) that contradicts its significance (what it is, the stabilized entity). What characterizes a paradox is the motion between its structure and significance, where the structure implies that its significance contradicts its structure, and vice versa.\n\nAnother example of a paradox would be “wholeness.” Wholeness (totality, infinite, boundless) can only be wholeness if we can find a way to define it so that it includes everything and there is nothing beyond it. However, if we define wholeness, then to have meaning, it must be bordered within the walls of the definition, which implies that there is something beyond this border, in which case it is not wholeness. Or in more formal language, wholeness is only wholeness if it is not wholeness, which is an inconsistency. If we are satisfied with that, then we have completed the definition of wholeness. However, if we try to include the beyond created by our earlier definition within the borders of our next attempt at defining wholeness, then we gain a new definition of wholeness, which by the sheer structure of the process of defining creates a new beyond. In this case, the process of defining wholeness will be consistent but incomplete, and wholeness will remain indefinite.\n\nContemplating the paradox of Creation, the ancient Egyptian myth of Creation springs to mind, the myth of the self-creating god, Amun (or Amon). Amun masturbated and swallowed his semen, after which he spit it out in the form of a ball, thereby impregnating his mother, the sky. And only then, was he born. Thus Amun was his own father. Those pious who discovered the illustrated version of this myth in Karnak covered up the erect phallus of Amun, and with it, this story of Creation was laid into obscurity. The Holophanic model of Creation could regard this Egyptian myth as Amun retromorphously creating himself. I have coined the word retromorphous to mean, defining in retrospect, turning non-being into the potential of whatever the observation is made from, or in other words, creating the past from the present, creating the source from its outcome, which is the basis of complexity in the context of the loop logic. That is, only after Amun was born can he give meaning to his mother, the potential from which he emanated and to the process that created him (as represented by masturbation and incest) whereby he was born. Of course, neither the sky nor the masturbating Amun have meaning until Creation takes place de facto and Amun emerges. I find this an enticing illustration of the basic paradox of existence.\n\nSo how can there be something from nothing? What is “nothing?” Nothing is what didn’t turn into the potential of something. If there was something from nothing, then that nothing would have turned into the potential of something, because when we ask, how is there something from nothing, we ask this question from something, when something already exists. If we take a deeper look at “nothing,” we’ll discover that “nothing” is a paradox. Any definition is something, so if we defined “nothing,” then it would become something, which contradicts its essence of being “nothing.” Another way of looking at “nothing” would be by means of it being something that is meaningless. That is, “nothing” could be something that does not relate and that no thing or no one relates to. That is, if there was something totally alone in the universe, then that would be nothing, but it would be meaningless. If such existed, its existence would be external to our perception, and as such, this “nothing” would be indefinite.\n\nWe said that the indefinite could be anything, as long as it is not specified (not defined). However, if we nevertheless tried to define “nothing” (the indefinite), what would we get then? Since “nothing” is non-definable, it is transparent as the object of our inquiry. So when we attempt to define it, all we have is what we put into it, which is the process of definition. “Nothing” stayed nothing, we didn’t define it, only made the process of definition explicit. “Nothing” gains meaning when we fail to define it; but having tried, we are left with a bonus, a something, which is our process of defining “nothing.” Creation of something from nothing is not a function of defining something, but a function of attempting to define “nothing.” And then, if that process of definition – which already is an existence – looks back at its origins, if this process of defining investigates into its own genesis, then what does it see? It sees itself. It sees the process of definition – self-reference.\n\nIf there is nothing external to perception, then this process of definition is the overall wholeness, the creator of meaning when it can relate to itself. However, to have meaning, the process of definition has to be defined; this definition would be a self-referential quasi-infinite and continuous process of establishing borders that create the indefinite beyond that establishes borders creating the indefinite beyond that establishes borders… which means, wholeness would continuously and forever fail to define itself while succeeding to define something – anything but itself.\n\nOf course, both the totally defined and the totally indefinite are idealized notions that would be inconsistent with the Holophanic loop logic, nor can they be found in nature. The totally indefinite would be the total meaningless nothing, the kind of non-being that cannot be fathomed because if we would think about it, it would already be something. On the other hand, there can be no total definition either. I have used the term uncertainty of sameness to describe the logical impossibility of total definition. A defined entity can be said to have reached sameness',NULL,599,'4',0,0,2,'2021-07-28',NULL,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,'2021-07-28 06:47:10','2021-07-29 02:01:56'),(175,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0.00,'36','1,6','Vampires The Romantic Ideology Behind Them','The French Revolution constituted for the conscience of the dominant aristocratic class a fall from innocence, and upturning of the natural chain of events that resounded all over Europe; the old regime became, in their imaginary, a paradise lost. This explains why some romantic poets born in the higher classes were keen on seeing themselves as faded aristocrats, expelled from their comfortable milieu by a reverse of fortune or a design of destiny. Byron and Shelley are the prime instances of this vital pose. In The Giaour he writes on a vampiric character: “The common crowd but see the gloom/ Of wayward deeds and fitting doom;/ The close observer can espy/A noble soul, and lineage high.”\n\n\n\nByron departed from England leaving a trail of scandal over his marital conduct and since then saw himself as an exiled expatriate. Shelley was expelled from Oxford and he fell in disgrace by marrying an in-keeper’s daughter; he always struggled to reconcile his origin with his political ideas: “Shelley could find no way of resolving his own contradictory opinions” (Cronin, 2000).\n\nThis icon of the fallen aristocrat is rooted on another character revered by romantic poets: the fallen angel. As Mario Praz proves, miltonic Satan became the rebel figure of choice among romantic poets. Milton reversed the medieval idea of a hideous Satan and wrapped its figure with the epic grandeur of an angel fallen in disgrace. Many of the byronic heros share with Milton’s Satan this fallen-from-grace condition, such as Lara: “There was in him a vital scorn of all:/\n\nAs if the worst had fall’n which could befall,/ stood a stranger in this breathing world,/An erring spirit from another hurl’d” ( Lara XVIII 315-16)\n\nThere is another social factor that is behind the formation of the romantic myth of the vampire. In the early nineteen century, the foundations of what would later become a mass society were laid; the expansion of the press and of the reading public produced an increased diffusion for literary works and fostered movements such as the gothic and the sensation novel. Byron himself experienced the event of being turned into a proto-bestseller. The unification of literary taste and preferences that was a correlate to this social changes could not be more alien to the romantic notion of individual gusto and original sensibility. In order to combat this unifying forces, romantic poets revered the individual who stands outside society and is free from common concerns. Many of Byron’s heros look down on the masses from above, even though they walk among them and do not lean towards wordsworthian escapades into nature; they achieve to remain untainted by the masses in a sort of exile within the world akin to that of a ghost or a dammed spirit. This self-definition of Manfred is revelatory:\n\nFrom my youth upwards\n\nMy spirit walk’d not with the souls of men,\n\nNor look’d upon the earth with human eyes;\n\nThe thirst of their ambition was not mine,\n\nThe aim of their existence was not mine;\n\nMy joys, my griefs, my passions, and my powers\n\nMade me a stranger; though I wore the form,\n\nI had no sympathy with breathing flesh, (Manfred II, ii, 50-58)\n\nNot only Byron’s works contrived to produce the modern image of the vampire in relation to the Male Seducer archetype, but also some odd events in his life and the life of those surrounding him exercised a decisive influence. A critical study bundled with an anthology of vampire tales (Conde de Siruela, 2001) attributes to the short story The Vampire (1819) by John William Polidori the fixation of the “classical images of the literary vampire as a villanious, cold and enigmatic aristocrat; but, above all, perverse and fascinating for women”. Mario Praz, in the same line, also states that Byron was “largely responsible for the vogue of vampirism”. Polidori was the unfortunate doctor and personal assistant of Lord Byron who died half-crazy at 25. The idea for the tale published in 1819 came from the famous meetings at Villa Diodati on June 1816 between Byron, Percy Shelley, Mary Shelley and Polidori, in what was probably the most influential gathering for fantastic fiction in the history of modern literature. In order to pass the stormy and ether-fuelled nights, they agreed to write each one a ghost story. Mary Shelley (who was then 17 years old) got during these nights the idea of what later became Frankenstein and Polidori wrote the tale The Vampire that he would publish three years later. The story appeared in the New Monthly Magazine falsely attributed by the editor to Lord Byron (taking advantages of the aura of Satanism that surrounded the poet in the popular view to promote the sales of the magazine). A misguided Goethe hailed the story as the best that Lord Byron had ever written. The tale was, actually, a covert portrait of Lord Byron disguised as the vampire Lord Ruthven, a cruel gambler and killer of innocent girls. Polidori had introduced in the story fragments from an autobiographical and revengeful novel called Glenarvon written by Caroline Lamb, an ex-lover of Byron.

It is the fundamental emotion that stands at the cradle of true art and true science.”\n\nAlbert Einstein, The World as I See It, 1931\n\nThe debate between realism and anti-realism is, at least, a century old. Does Science describe the real world – or are its theories true only within a certain conceptual framework? Is science only instrumental or empirically adequate or is there more to it than that?\n\nThe current – mythological – image of scientific enquiry is as follows:\n\nWithout resorting to reality, one can, given infinite time and resources, produce all conceivable theories. One of these theories is bound to be the “truth”. To decide among them, scientists conduct experiments and compare their results to predictions yielded by the theories. A theory is falsified when one or more of its predictions fails. No amount of positive results – i.e., outcomes that confirm the theory’s predictions – can “prove right” a theory. Theories can only be proven false by that great arbiter, reality.\n\nJose Ortega y Gasset said (in an unrelated exchange) that all ideas stem from pre-rational beliefs. William James concurred by saying that accepting a truth often requires an act of will which goes beyond facts and into the realm of feelings. Maybe so, but there is little doubt today that beliefs are somehow involved in the formation of many scientific ideas, if not of the very endeavor of Science. After all, Science is a human activity and humans always believe that things exist (=are true) or could be true.\n\nA distinction is traditionally made between believing in something’s existence, truth, value of appropriateness (this is the way that it ought to be) – and believing that something. The latter is a propositional attitude: we think that something, we wish that something, we feel that something and we believe that something. Believing in A and believing that A – are different.\n\nIt is reasonable to assume that belief is a limited affair. Few of us would tend to believe in contradictions and falsehoods. Catholic theologians talk about explicit belief (in something which is known to the believer to be true) versus implicit one (in the known consequences of something whose truth cannot be known). Truly, we believe in the probability of something (we, thus, express an opinion) – or in its certain existence (truth).\n\nAll humans believe in the existence of connections or relationships between things. This is not something which can be proven or proven false (to use Popper’s test). That things consistently follow each other does not prove they are related in any objective, “real”, manner – except in our minds. This belief in some order (if we define order as permanent relations between separate physical or abstract entities) permeates both Science and Superstition. They both believe that there must be – and is – a connection between things out there.\n\nScience limits itself and believes that only certain entities inter-relate within well defined conceptual frames (called theories). Not everything has the potential to connect to everything else. Entities are discriminated, differentiated, classified and assimilated in worldviews in accordance with the types of connections that they forge with each other.\n\nMoreover, Science believes that it has a set of very effective tools to diagnose, distinguish, observe and describe these relationships. It proves its point by issuing highly accurate predictions based on the relationships discerned through the use of said tools. Science (mostly) claims that these connections are “true” in the sense that they are certain – not probable.\n\nThe cycle of formulation, prediction and falsification (or proof) is the core of the human scientific activity. Alleged connections that cannot be captured in these nets of reasoning are cast out either as “hypothetical” or as “false”. In other words: Science defines “relations between entities” as “relations between entities which have been established and tested using the scientific apparatus and arsenal of tools”. This, admittedly, is a very cyclical argument, as close to tautology as it gets.\n\nSuperstition is a much simpler matter: everything is connected to everything in ways unbeknown to us. We can only witness the results of these subterranean currents and deduce the existence of such currents from the observable flotsam. The planets influence our lives, dry coffee sediments contain information about the future, black cats portend disasters, certain dates are propitious, certain numbers are to be avoided. The world is unsafe because it can never be fathomed. But the fact that we – limited as we are – cannot learn about a hidden connection – should not imply that it does not exist.\n\nScience believes in two categories of relationships between entities (physical and abstract alike). The one is the category of direct links – the other that of links through a third entity. In the first case, A and B are seen to be directly related. In the second case, there is no apparent link between A and B, but a third entity, C could well provide such a connection (for instance, if A and B are parts of C or are separately, but concurrently somehow influenced by it).\n\nEach of these two categories is divided to three subcategories: causal relationships, functional relationships and correlative relationship.\n\nA and B will be said to be causally related if A precedes B, B never occurs if A does not precede it and always occurs after A occurs. To the discerning eye, this would seem to be a relationship of correlation (“whenever A happens B happens”) and this is true. Causation is subsumed by a the 1.0 correlation relationship category. In other words: it is a private case of the more general case of correlation.\n\nA and B are functionally related if B can be predicted by assuming A but we have no way of establishing the truth value of A. The latter is a postulate or axiom.

Astrology is defined as ‘the art or practice of determining the supposed influences of the planets and their motions on human affairs and human disposition’. From this practice a horoscope can be produced – a diagram (or chart) of the relative positions of planets and signs of the Zodiac at a specific time, usually the time of birth. A forecast can then be produced.\n\nThe Zodiac:\n\nWestern Astrology originated way back, around 500 BC, with a concept called the Zodiac being developed. This comprised of an imaginary sphere surrounding the earth, which followed the path of the Sun through the constellations during the year. The Zodiac was split into twelve sections, each named after the specific constellation noted in that area.\n\n\n\nElements:\n\nMany ancient philosophies used a set of classical elements to explain the way nature behaved. Each sign was connected to one of the classical elements (fire, earth, air, or water) and was also related to a region of focus; social, personal or universal.\n\n* Water signs are related to growth processes, identification and emotion. In tandem with the other elements, water feels that fire will make it boil, air will evaporate it, but earth will shape and channel it.\n\n* Fire signs are related to action, passion, and energy. In tandem with the other elements, fire feels that earth will smother it, water will drown it, but air will fan and enliven it.\n\n* Air signs are related to thought, perspective and communication. In tandem with the other elements, air feels that water will obscure it, earth will suffocate it, but fire will inspire and uplift it.\n\n* Earth signs are related to sensation, stability, and practicality. In tandem with the other elements, earth feels that air will dry it, fire will dry it, but water will refresh and nourish it.\n\nModalities:\n\nEach sign is connected to one of three modalities; cardinal (sometimes referred to as movable), fixed, and mutable.\n\nThere are four quadrants following the order of the zodiacal signs, with three signs in each. Each quadrant describes a season, beginning with a cardinal sign, continuing to a fixed sign, and ending with a mutable sign.\n\nModalities and Related Zodiac Signs:\n\n* Mutable signs are related to adaptability, resourcefulness and holism. They are Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius and Pisces.\n\n* Fixed signs are related to determination, focus and individuality. They are Taurus, Leo, Scorpio and Aquarius.\n\n* Cardinal signs are related to creativity and initiation. They are Aries, Cancer, Libra and Capricorn.\n\nSummary of Zodiac Sign Characteristics:\n\n* Aries (cardinal, fire, personal): defensive, energetic, head down, assertive, impulsive.\n\n* Taurus (fixed, earth, personal): patient, indulgent, resourceful, thorough, devoted.\n\n* Gemini (mutable, air, personal): quick, logical, inquisitive.\n\n* Cancer (cardinal, water, personal): clinging, protective, sensitive.\n\n* Leo (fixed, fire, social): theatrical, generous, proud.\n\n* Virgo (mutable, earth, social): critically, practical, efficient.\n\n* Libra (cardinal, air, social): lazy, co-operative, fair.\n\n* Scorpio (fixed, water, social): anxious, passionate, sensitive.\n\n* Sagittarius (mutable, fire, universal): careless, free, straightforward.\n\n* Capricorn (cardinal, earth, universal): suspicious, prudent, cautious.\n\n* Aquarius (fixed, air, universal): detached, democratic, unconventional.\n\n* Pisces (mutable, water, universal): distracted, imaginative, sensitive.',NULL,236,'4',0,0,5,'2021-07-28',NULL,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,'2021-07-28 07:25:26','2021-12-01 16:29:02'),(179,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0.00,'36','1','The Idea Of God Is Not Henceforth Relevant','Well educated, intellectual people, especially scientists at all times demonstrate considerably smaller adherence to religiosity than others. However, there are still believers of the idea of the God in science. If we exclude from their number those who feel a painful requirement for external protection and support by virtue of their poor living circumstances, there are those who come to idea of the God as a result of amazement at a world that has many unsolved problems. The surprising diversification of subjects and entities can be scientifically formulated in principle as it can sustain the quasi-stable condition and demonstrates development.\n\nCommon sense suggests, that for an explanation of the observable diversification in life, it is necessary to admit that each separate subject, each organism, each social unit, and even each computer program should contain a special internal causative engine, a local determinism, which maintains an autonomous internal life in it.\n\nThe conventional concept of determinism does not suppose the existence of such sources. This represents a scandalous weakness in the concept. Not finding the required causative source within the framework of philosophy, people are compelled to address the always-available, exotic, exciting fantasies of the irrational sources that are available in religion and mysticism.\n\nToday the situation can be considerably rectified. The recently published concept of Ring Determinism identifies the required internal causative source by way of a closed plot of the customary causal chain. This is a self-contained circuit which, it turns out, is contained in the entrails of each separate natural formation. This circuit is just that ontological base in which each separate natural formation finds and displays its exclusive individuality and asserts itself in the capacity of “causa sui ” – the cause of itself.\n\nInternal local causative action, continuously circulating inside a separate body, is transmitted from element to element. It ensures its systemic, synergetic wholeness in the operation of its elements and subsystems in the phenomena of “emergence”, special internal policy, resistance to external actions, aggression directed externally, egotism, egocentricity, self-preservation, self-organization and finally, self-development.\n\nOne of the conclusions of ring determinism is, that under the supervisory control of the internal cause continuously circulating in a body, and under the continuous effects of external factors, there is the miracle of self-development. This results in an observable diversification of surprising properties of subjects, organisms, social units, human products and other things.\n\nThe local causative circuit can randomly or by design, become closed. Then finding an ability towards long-lived quasi-stable self-maintenance, self-resumption, or, in the case of dynamically developing systems, the determining vortex, it becomes the high-power engine which creates, saves and induces a flock of living and nonliving natural formations in development.\n\nEducated people can now sigh with relief since a rather weighty rational argument against the idea of creationism has appeared and the necessity to appeal to irrational theories has vanished.',NULL,212,'4',0,0,1,'2021-07-28',NULL,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,'2021-07-28 09:24:20','2021-07-29 16:42:48'),(180,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0.00,'36','1','Enlightenment Is Not Just One State','Many people has the notion that enlightenment is one state. Many also believe that when it is attained, a person is forever in that state.\n\nThe following is not a definitive article on this subject. It is just an expression of my own thoughts.\n\nMy opinion is that enlightenment is not just one state but is a progressive and gradual establishing of states of consciousness.\n\nI, myself have not reach the end of the road. But from years on a spiritual quest, I can safely say that enlightenment happens in a series or stages of self-realisations and self-discoveries.\n\nUsually there is a difference between an initial awakening and a later stabilisation of that stage that happens through practice or experiences. The initial awakenings are new discoveries about the dynamics of consciousness, while the stabilisation is the assimilation of what is being discovered into one’s life experience. Sometimes, a new discovery can completely over-rule or modify upon an older one.\n\nAlmost all stages of enlightenment can be said to be associated with Presence. However, the enlightening Presence comes in various degrees of intensity and clarity. The degree of intensity is directly dependent on the level and depth of one’s clarity as well as one’s realisations/discoveries.\n\nAlso, as one progresses along, the relationship or connections of oneself to the universe and existence at large also becomes clearer.\n\nBelow very briefly illustrates the progressive and stage-based nature of enlightenment:\n\nWhen one first begin meditating, one may first experience the all-pervading Presence. This Presence, is most often experienced when thoughts are momentarily suspended. This Presence which exists in the Eternal Present Moment is our true self.\n\nHowever such an experience can only be classified as an awakening to the true self.. which is no-self. This is because, after the meditation, the Presence seems to have disappeared. One cannot understand and find the connection of presence to our everyday life. Therefore one will have difficulty re-acquiring the Presence. And it takes many stages and series of realisation to understand the relationship of Presence to our phenomenal world. It can be said that the prolonged sustaining of Presence is dependent on the stages and depth of realisation.\n\nAlso, during the earlier stages we may mistaken another state to be the pure presence. For example, we may mistaken ‘I AM’ for pure presence. This is because the thinking mind has created a reflective image of Pure Presence. This reflection of the absolute is ‘I AM’.\n\nUsually, in order to pass through the ‘I AM’ stage, the person must move unto even deeper understandings. These understandings may include realising that one’s personality is not the doer of action. This stage may persist for a while before the person realises the illusion of subject-object division. This stage involves recognising the hypnotic impression of there being an observer and the being observed. Here is where one begins to see through the illusionary nature of our phenomenal world.\n\nI cannot comment on the stages before me as they are beyond me.

You very rarely smile, you are negative about most issues and you always seem to be carrying the world on your shoulders”.\n\nThis man was aged around fifty three and continued:\n\n“I used to be like you and then I was given some advice, of which I am now going to relay to you. When you feel down, depressed or sorry for yourself, read the newspapers or watch the news on the television. You may then realise that you are in fact one of the lucky ones.”\n\nI listened and thought about what he had said. I had never been a big reader or watcher of the news, but decided to start. The advice was totally correct, the news from around the world and even my own country was quite shocking. I realised that the worries I had were actually quite trivial and that I needed to cherish everyday and start to look on the bright side of life.',NULL,97,'4',0,0,4,'2021-07-28',NULL,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,'2021-07-28 09:38:29','2021-09-29 18:03:21'),(182,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0.00,'36','1','Religion And Science','There are many kinds of narratives and organizing principles. Science is driven by evidence gathered in experiments, and by the falsification of extant theories and their replacement with newer, asymptotically truer, ones. Other systems – religion, nationalism, paranoid ideation, or art – are based on personal experiences (faith, inspiration, paranoia, etc.).\n\nExperiential narratives can and do interact with evidential narratives and vice versa.\n\nFor instance: belief in God inspires some scientists who regard science as a method to “peek at God’s cards” and to get closer to Him. Another example: the pursuit of scientific endeavors enhances one’s national pride and is motivated by it. Science is often corrupted in order to support nationalistic and racist claims.\n\nThe basic units of all narratives are known by their effects on the environment. God, in this sense, is no different from electrons, quarks, and black holes. All four constructs cannot be directly observed, but the fact of their existence is derived from their effects.\n\nGranted, God’s effects are discernible only in the social and psychological (or psychopathological) realms. But this observed constraint doesn’t render Him less “real”. The hypothesized existence of God parsimoniously explains a myriad ostensibly unrelated phenomena and, therefore, conforms to the rules governing the formulation of scientific theories.\n\nThe locus of God’s hypothesized existence is, clearly and exclusively, in the minds of believers. But this again does not make Him less real. The contents of our minds are as real as anything “out there”. Actually, the very distinction between epistemology and ontology is blurred.\n\nBut is God’s existence “true” – or is He just a figment of our neediness and imagination?\n\nTruth is the measure of the ability of our models to describe phenomena and predict them. God’s existence (in people’s minds) succeeds to do both. For instance, assuming that God exists allows us to predict many of the behaviors of people who profess to believe in Him. The existence of God is, therefore, undoubtedly true (in this formal and strict sense).\n\nBut does God exist outside people’s minds? Is He an objective entity, independent of what people may or may not think about Him? After all, if all sentient beings were to perish in a horrible calamity, the Sun would still be there, revolving as it has done from time immemorial.\n\nIf all sentient beings were to perish in a horrible calamity, would God still exist? If all sentient beings, including all humans, stop believing that there is God – would He survive this renunciation? Does God “out there” inspire the belief in God in religious folks’ minds?\n\nKnown things are independent of the existence of observers (although the Copenhagen interpretation of Quantum Mechanics disputes this). Believed things are dependent on the existence of believers.\n\nWe know that the Sun exists. We don’t know that God exists. We believe that God exists – but we don’t and cannot know it, in the scientific sense of the word.\n\nWe can design experiments to falsify (prove wrong) the existence of electrons, quarks, and black holes (and, thus, if all these experiments fail, prove that electrons, quarks, and black holes exist). We can also design experiments to prove that electrons, quarks, and black holes exist.\n\nBut we cannot design even one experiment to falsify the existence of a God who is outside the minds of believers (and, thus, if the experiment fails, prove that God exists “out there”). Additionally, we cannot design even one experiment to prove that God exists outside the minds of believers.\n\nWhat about the “argument from design”? The universe is so complex and diverse that surely it entails the existence of a supreme intelligence, the world’s designer and creator, known by some as “God”. On the other hand, the world’s richness and variety can be fully accounted for using modern scientific theories such as evolution and the big bang. There is no need to introduce God into the equations.\n\nStill, it is possible that God is responsible for it all. The problem is that we cannot design even one experiment to falsify this theory, that God created the Universe (and, thus, if the experiment fails, prove that God is, indeed, the world’s originator). Additionally, we cannot design even one experiment to prove that God created the world.\n\nWe can, however, design numerous experiments to falsify the scientific theories that explain the creation of the Universe (and, thus, if these experiments fail, lend these theories substantial support). We can also design experiments to prove the scientific theories that explain the creation of the Universe.\n\nIt does not mean that these theories are absolutely true and immutable. They are not. Our current scientific theories are partly true and are bound to change with new knowledge gained by experimentation. Our current scientific theories will be replaced by newer, truer theories. But any and all future scientific theories will be falsifiable and testable.\n\nKnowledge and belief are like oil and water. They don’t mix. Knowledge doesn’t lead to belief and belief does not yield knowledge. Belief can yield conviction or strongly-felt opinions. But belief cannot result in knowledge.\n\nStill, both known things and believed things exist. The former exist “out there” and the latter “in our minds” and only there.

This held true in most cultures and societies throughout history.\n\nOn first impression, the last sentence sounds patently wrong. We all know about human collectives that regarded human lives as dispensable, that murdered and tortured, that cleansed and annihilated whole populations in recurrent genocides. Surely, these defy the aforementioned statement?\n\nLiberal philosophies claim that human life was treated as a prime value throughout the ages. Authoritarian regimes do not contest the over-riding importance of this value. Life is sacred, valuable, to be cherished and preserved. But, in totalitarian societies, it can be deferred, subsumed, subjected to higher goals, quantized, and, therefore, applied with differential rigor in the following circumstances:\n\n1.. Quantitative – when a lesser evil prevents a greater one. Sacrificing the lives of the few to save the lives of the many is a principle enshrined and embedded in activities such as war and medicinal care. All cultures, no matter how steeped (or rooted) in liberal lore accept it. They all send soldiers to die to save the more numerous civilian population. Medical doctors sacrifice lives daily, to save others.\n\nIt is boils down to a quantitative assessment (“the numerical ratio between those saved and those sacrificed”), and to questions of quality (“are there privileged lives whose saving or preservation is worth the sacrifice of others’ lives?”) and of evaluation (no one can safely predict the results of such moral dilemmas – will lives be saved as the result of the sacrifice?).\n\n2.. Temporal – when sacrificing life (voluntarily or not) in the present secures a better life for others in the future. These future lives need not be more numerous than the lives sacrificed. A life in the future immediately acquires the connotation of youth in need of protection. It is the old sacrificed for the sake of the new, a trade off between those who already had their share of life – and those who hadn’t. It is the bloody equivalent of a savings plan: one defers present consumption to the future.\n\nThe mirror image of this temporal argument belongs to the third group (see next), the qualitative one. It prefers to sacrifice a life in the present so that another life, also in the present, will continue to exist in the future. Abortion is an instance of this approach: the life of the child is sacrificed to secure the future well-being of the mother. In Judaism, it is forbidden to kill a female bird. Better to kill its off-spring. The mother has the potential to compensate for this loss of life by bringing giving birth to other chicks.\n\n3.. Qualitative – This is an especially vicious variant because it purports to endow subjective notions and views with “scientific” objectivity. People are judged to belong to different qualitative groups (classified by race, skin color, birth, gender, age, wealth, or other arbitrary parameters). The result of this immoral taxonomy is that the lives of the “lesser” brands of humans are considered less “weighty” and worthy than the lives of the upper grades of humanity. The former are therefore sacrificed to benefit the latter. The Jews in Nazi occupied Europe, the black slaves in America, the aborigines in Australia are three examples of such pernicious thinking.\n\n4.. Utilitarian – When the sacrifice of one life brings another person material or other benefits. This is the thinking (and action) which characterizes psychopaths and sociopathic criminals, for instance. For them, life is a tradable commodity and it can be exchanged against inanimate goods and services. Money and drugs are bartered for life.',NULL,217,'4',0,0,3,'2021-07-28',NULL,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,'2021-07-28 09:50:57','2021-12-01 16:32:16'),(184,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0.00,'36','1','Philosophy As A Science','Philosophy is considered a science but it is difficult to say, when one has to compare with an ordinary science, for example biology, or chemistry. This is a question that turns into a burning problem among the scientists and linguists all over the world. Can philosophy be a science? What does philosophy operate with? It operates with categories, which can be as wide and as interchangeable as one can only imagine. Ordinary science operates with definitions, which are quite limited in their field of research. Ordinary science uses terms and laws of that very science to continue the research, uniting with the others in very rare cases. Philosophy gets into the sense of every science trying to achieve results.\n\nWe also can not call philosophy a supra-science, for it also uses hypothesis and arguments to state the opinion. But there is the obvious thing: there are now laws in philosophy and never will be, for the science changes with the age, the needs, beliefs and requirements of the citizens. To prove your opinion, you can write the definition essay and state all the facts and arguments you know to prove one way or another. This is also a nice way to research the problem and see what the solution is. But you have to research it carefully; otherwise definition essays will not be fruitful. As all sciences philosophy has gone through its stages of development. Some scientists believe that the crib of philosophy was mythology and religion. If to see the principles of life and some primitive morals stated in some myths we may see that the statement is quite true and philosophy still continues to develop out of social beliefs and ideas. Philosophy is a science which is obligatory learned by every college student in order for him to establish his own philosophy of life. It is quite exciting to find answers to ever existing questions: who am I? What do I know? What can I know? What am I destined to do? Here is one more interesting observation. You can see that all famous philosophers were researching other science fields also. For example, Freud, Yung, Kafka and others were doing research in linguistics and social sciences. Their numerous creations are the pride of human history for they revealed some secrets that remained undiscovered for a long time before their great contributions.\n\nThere are so many currents and branches, so many schools of philosophy that it is hard to decide, which one do you prefer and agree with. This much depends on the country, family, society you live in. This is one more difference between philosophy and other natural sciences. The law is stable for any country; gravity exists in India, same as in Brazil. Philosophy is a hard science, for it is very difficult to understand the sense of the dogma reading it only once. It is of course, not easy, but gives credit for you if you get interested and somewhere, being at the social event you quote one of the famous doctors of philosophy and make a great impression of an educated and intelligent personality.',NULL,206,'4',0,0,1,'2021-07-28',NULL,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,'2021-07-28 09:57:32','2021-08-16 19:38:59'),(185,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0.00,'36','1','Words To Live By','Watching the news the other day, it occurred to me that people who have “words to live by” often begin to attack and even kill others. I thought back to my own angry youth, when I could easily use words to justify violent thoughts which might have become violent actions. Words are tools, and yet it seems that they can be more dangerous than gunpowder.\n\nImagine two men facing each other, pointing past one another. One is pointing at a tornado that is coming, and the other at a raging fire headed towards them. Each sees their own truth and is angry at the sight of the other’s hand. Each feels that the other’s hand is “wrong.” This may seem silly, but replace the tornado and fire with any modern issues, and the hands with words, and this scene describes how we often try to communicate.\n\nWe point past each other with our words, arguing as though we are looking at the same facts and experiences. We want to prove our words are the right ones, instead of learning to look at what the other’s words are pointing at. Words are seductive, and for all their undeniable usefulness, they also can lead us away from understanding when we focus on them, when we make them more important than the truth they are meant to point at.\n\nThere Are No Words To Live By\n\nThis isn’t just about communication with others. We focus on, and get trapped in a net of words that we use to explain the world to ourselves. We call things “right” or “wrong” for example, according to how they compare to our “definitions.” Unlike mathematics, though, word formulas and definitions can never be so precise. They cannot encompass the whole truth of reality. For example, with the least effort, you can create a circumstance where “stealing” would be right, and “helping” someone wrong.\n\nThis isn’t an argument against using language or logic. It is just that both only go so far. Like a car that takes you across the country or world, they are useful, but like a car, they are only useful in certain ways, and you have to get out of them when you arrive at your various destinations. Taking a car to the lake isn’t a problem, but taking it into the lake is. This is what we do when our words and logic take us to dangerous situations.\n\nCan having words to live by be dangerous, though? Absolutely. I once heard an otherwise compassionate person say he was against animal cruelty laws because he couldn’t find a logical and defensible set of words to defend them. If he saw a new machine, would he refuse to believe it existed until he could explain it and describe it? Reality, and the reality of right and wrong exist outside of words – they are not the words themselves.\n\nI watched a man say on the evening news that we have the right to drop a nuclear bomb on Iraq, and that we should. As he explained why, you could see that whatever compassionate impulses he had, they were over-ruled by his total allegiance to his words, logic, and where these take him. It never occurred to him that maybe there is truth outside of his words and logic.\n\nIt’s great to have guidelines, like “don’t lie,” or “we have the right to defend ourselves.” It is even better to remember that these rules will someday fail us, and we will have to make new ones. Words are just tools. There are words to die by, but there are no words to live by.',NULL,204,'4',0,0,0,'2021-07-29',NULL,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,'2021-07-28 10:03:53','2021-07-29 11:36:47'),(186,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0.00,'36','1','When The Morning Dawns','The following article covers a topic that has recently moved to center stage–at least it seems that way. If you’ve been thinking you need to know more about unconditional love, here’s your opportunity.\n\nWhen darkness turns to day, the sun moves over the horizon and touches everything in sight. This movement across the landscape brightens everything. Such an illumination awakens us all. We rise with energy moving in and through us allowing us to create a new day. A day unique from all the rest and creatively woven into our soul.\n\n\n\nThis is the landscape of our soul. As you can see, nature has a way of showing us just how powerful we are. The same power that created the moon and the stars and the movement of all space and time lies within the human heart. It is the heart of creation itself, and perhaps, the heart of our Creator.\n\n\n\nHuman beings are fortunate to be able to be aware of our awareness. This awareness gives us an opportunity to reflect on our soul and find blessing in being alive. Our consciousness of a creative force inside us guiding us into this world, through it, and eventually to our eternal home allows us to fulfill a purpose on this earth.\n\n\n\nSuch a purpose is beyond our own ability to really know. Yet, we can open our heart enough to allow our purpose to find us. This is done by recognizing that the things in life that really matter ARE the things in life that isn’t matter.\n\n\n\nYes, it is our soul’s longing to fulfill the purpose for which we came to earth for. No one really knows how a baby is conceived totally. Science and human understanding still hasn’t been able to fully comprehend such a force of nature. We can only embrace what is beyond us and find a way to bring into being forces of nature such as a tiny child.\n\n\n\nWhen a child is born, we are in awe. The miracle of birth creates something inside us all. It is the remembrance that life does not come from us. Instead, life comes through us. As such, we are living in a dream come true. All of us are probably living our soul’s purpose more than we know, and even, can know. It is the mystery of all mysteries.\n\n\n\nThis does not explain why some of us find peace and other’s find pain. But, such a philosophy will enable us all to find grace in knowing our lives create in our world facets of ourselves we all are a part of. An understanding of such grace gives every one of us a chance to find mercy and grace and the same unconditional love we came into the world with when we were born.\n\nSamuel Oliver, author of, “What the Dying Teach Us: Lessons on Living”',NULL,157,'4',0,0,0,'2021-07-28',NULL,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,'2021-07-28 10:08:00','2021-07-29 11:37:10'),(187,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0.00,'36','1','Peace On Earth A Wonderful Wish But No Way','When asked, “If you could wish for one thing only, what would that wish be?” almost everyone; from beauty pagent contestants, to politicians, to religious leaders, to children, to the average person on the street states, “Peace On Earth” or “An end to all wars”. Those wishes, while exemplary, are meaningless. As long as humans exist there will never be peace on earth.\n\nThroughout the history of humankind there has never been peace on earth. Cavemen fought other cavemen over territory, food and even women. Cain killed Abel over God’s respect. Gabriel blew down the walls of Jericho. America fought the Revolutionary War for freedom and brother fought against brother in our Civil War for more freedom. There have always been wars and there will always be wars.\n\nAs long as humans can think, there will be wars. Wars over such concepts as freedom, honor, dignity, etc.. Wars over territory, greed, power, prejudice, etc.. War is a part of human nature. For example, every human being is prejudiced. If they don’t like some race, nationality or religion, they don’t like short or tall or fat or skinny or smart or not smart or loud or quiet people. Some people don’t like children, some people don’t like old people, some people don’t like people with pets, or people that play their music too loud, or bad drivers, or people that believe in God or people that don’t believe in God. What is right and proper to some people can be wrong or even enraging to other people.\n\nReligion can not stop wars, in fact many wars are fought over religion (Note: I believe that religion is used as an excuse for war not the real reason for war.). Christians fought against Muslims during the Crusades, Many Muslims want death for all non believers. The Catholic Church killed heretics during the Inquisition. The Nazis killed millions of Jews and then started killing Catholics. The Russians under Stalin killed anyone even remotly religious. Protestants killed other Protestants for being the wrong type of Protestant. Muslims killed Muslims for being the wrong type of Muslim. Don’t forget about Atheists (I believe that Atheism is also a religion, it is a religion of non belief.), Stalin was an Atheist and wanted to get rid of all religion. Most of China’s leaders are Atheists and have jailed and killed huge numbers of religious people. History is rife with various types of religious battles.\n\nThe main reason for war, however, is the lust for power. The power to make others do and believe as you do and believe, the power to make other people render unto you what you believe is rightfully yours, the power to make other people treat you as you believe you should be treated, the power to gain what you want (ie: money, love, respect, etc.), the power to punish others for doing things that you don’t believe they should do, the power to keep other from having things or thoughts that you don’t have. In other words, the power to be, in some ways God, to make everyone else in your image with you as their ruler.\n\nAs long as people have the ability to think, there will be greed, envy, prejudice and anger. As long as those things exist, there will be wars. Most people believe, either religiously or secularly, in the rules set down in the Ten Commandments, but very few people can follow those rules all of the time because our ability to think causes us to want. Wanting causes us to break some or all of the rules. Humans are not perfect.

But it is quite obvious that they do not relate to facts “out there”. They are not true statements.\n\nBut do they lack truth because they do not relate to facts? How are Truth and Fact interrelated?\n\nOne answer is that Truth pertains to the possibility that an event will occur. If true – it must occur and if false – it cannot occur. This is a binary world of extreme existential conditions. Must all possible events occur? Of course not. If they do not occur would they still be true? Must a statement have a real life correlate to be true?\n\nInstinctively, the answer is yes. We cannot conceive of a thought divorced from brainwaves. A statement which remains a mere potential seems to exist only in the nether land between truth and falsity. It becomes true only by materializing, by occurring, by matching up with real life. If we could prove that it will never do so, we would have felt justified in classifying it as false. This is the outgrowth of millennia of concrete, Aristotelian logic. Logical statements talk about the world and, therefore, if a statement cannot be shown to relate directly to the world, it is not true.\n\nThis approach, however, is the outcome of some underlying assumptions:\n\nFirst, that the world is finite and also close to its end. To say that something that did not happen cannot be true is to say that it will never happen (i.e., to say that time and space – the world – are finite and are about to end momentarily).\n\nSecond, truth and falsity are assumed to be mutually exclusive. Quantum and fuzzy logics have long laid this one to rest. There are real world situations that are both true and not-true. A particle can “be” in two places at the same time. This fuzzy logic is incompatible with our daily experiences but if there is anything that we have learnt from physics in the last seven decades it is that the world is incompatible with our daily experiences.\n\nThe third assumption is that the psychic realm is but a subset of the material one. We are membranes with a very particular hole-size. We filter through only well defined types of experiences, are equipped with limited (and evolutionarily biased) senses, programmed in a way which tends to sustain us until we die. We are not neutral, objective observers. Actually, the very concept of observer is disputable – as modern physics, on the one hand and Eastern philosophy, on the other hand, have shown.\n\nImagine that a mad scientist has succeeded to infuse all the water in the world with a strong hallucinogen. At a given moment, all the people in the world see a huge flying saucer. What can we say about this saucer? Is it true? Is it “real”?\n\nThere is little doubt that the saucer does not exist. But who is to say so? If this statement is left unsaid – does it mean that it cannot exist and, therefore, is untrue? In this case (of the illusionary flying saucer), the statement that remains unsaid is a true statement – and the statement that is uttered by millions is patently false.\n\nStill, the argument can be made that the flying saucer did exist – though only in the minds of those who drank the contaminated water. What is this form of existence? In which sense does a hallucination “exist”? The psychophysical problem is that no causal relationship can be established between a thought and its real life correlate, the brainwaves that accompany it. Moreover, this leads to infinite regression. If the brainwaves created the thought – who created them, who made them happen? In other words: who is it (perhaps what is it) that thinks?\n\nThe subject is so convoluted that to say that the mental is a mere subset of the material is to speculate\n\nIt is, therefore, advisable to separate the ontological from the epistemological. But which is which? Facts are determined epistemologically and statistically by conscious and intelligent observers. Their “existence” rests on a sound epistemological footing. Yet we assume that in the absence of observers facts will continue their existence, will not lose their “factuality”, their real life quality which is observer-independent and invariant.\n\nWhat about truth? Surely, it rests on solid ontological foundations. Something is or is not true in reality and that is it. But then we saw that truth is determined psychically and, therefore, is vulnerable, for instance, to hallucinations. Moreover, the blurring of the lines in Quantum, non-Aristotelian, logics implies one of two: either that true and false are only “in our heads” (epistemological) – or that something is wrong with our interpretation of the world, with our exegetic mechanism (brain). If the latter case is true that the world does contain mutually exclusive true and false values – but the organ which identifies these entities (the brain) has gone awry. The paradox is that the second approach also assumes that at least the perception of true and false values is dependent on the existence of an epistemological detection device.\n\nCan something be true and reality and false in our minds? Of course it can (remember “Rashomon”). Could the reverse be true? Yes, it can. This is what we call optical or sensory illusions. Even solidity is an illusion of our senses – there are no such things as solid objects (remember the physicist’s desk which is 99.99999% vacuum with minute granules of matter floating about).\n\nTo reconcile these two concepts, we must let go of the old belief (probably vital to our sanity) that we can know the world. We probably cannot and this is the source of our confusion. The world may be inhabited by “true” things and “false” things. It may be true that truth is existence and falsity is non-existence. But we will never know because we are incapable of knowing anything about the world as it is.\n\nWe are, however, fully equipped to know about the mental events inside our heads. It is there that the representations of the real world form. We are acquainted with these representations (concepts, images, symbols, language in general) – and mistake them for the world itself. Since we have no way of directly knowing the world (without the intervention of our interpretative mechanisms) we are unable to tell when a certain representation corresponds to an event which is observer-independent and invariant and when it corresponds to nothing of the kind. When we see an image – it could be the result of an interaction with light outside us (objectively “real”), or the result of a dream, a drug induced illusion, fatigue and any other number of brain events not correlated with the real world. These are observer-dependent phenomena and, subject to an agreement between a sufficient number of observers, they are judged to be true or “to have happened” (e.g., religious miracles).\n\nTo ask if something is true or not is not a meaningful question unless it relates to our internal world and to our capacity as observers. When we say “true” we mean “exists”, or “existed”, or “most definitely will exist” (the sun will rise tomorrow). But existence can only be ascertained in our minds. Truth, therefore, is nothing but a state of mind. Existence is determined by observing and comparing the two (the outside and the inside, the real and the mental). This yields a picture of the world which may be closely correlated to reality – and, yet again, may not.',NULL,503,'4',0,0,4,'2021-07-28',NULL,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,'2021-07-28 10:22:34','2021-09-29 17:50:29'),(189,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0.00,'36','1','The Emerald Buddha','The Emerald Buddha is a figurine of a sitting Budha, that is the is the palladium of the Kingdom of Thailand.

Other great historians beleive that it belongs to the Chiang Saen Style of the 15th century. The legend says that, it remained in Pataliputra for 300 hundred years, until it was taken to Sri Lanka to save it from a civil war. It was then in 457, that King Anuruth of Burma sent out orders to Ceylon to ask for the Emerald Budha and Buddhist scriptures. These actions took place by the king, to try and support Buddhism in his country. This request was granted, however the ship that was brining the Buddha to Burma, became lost in a storm and ended up in Cambodia. The Buddha made it’s way through several hands after that: Ayutthaya, Kamphaeng Phet, Lao and finally Chiang Rai. It was finally in Chiang Rai that the ruler of the city hid it.\n\nIt wasn’t until 1434 that sources indicate the resurfacing of the statue in Northern Thailand. There is one story about the discovery: “lightning struck a pagoda in a temple in Chiang Rai, after which something became visible under the stucco. The Emerald Buddha was dug out and the people thought the figurine was made from emerald, hence its current name.”\n\nAlthough, the Buddha is just a simple jade statue, it is dressed with garments that are made of fine gold.

Whether you are a true believer or a doubtful skeptic, evidence can be found with your own research on the secret codes of the bible.\n\nBible codes, sometimes referred to as Torah codes, have been part of the Jewish tradition and mystery for over 2000 years. In Hebrew (the language of the original bible) the bible codes are called Gematria which is a translation from ancient Greek which when translated in to English is numerology. Around the time that the Old Testament was written the Greeks were the world leaders in math, so it would be natural that they would influence the composers of the original bible codes. It is information like this that can be found in the software responsible for unlocking the bible codes.\n\nThe bible codes can also be seen in other forms of the bible not just the original Hebrew. The King James Version has hidden bible codes and mysteries just waiting to be unlocked.

Before you start practicing or using Feng Shui enhancements to your living environment it is important for you to know that it is for nourishing and healing your soul. In a Feng Shui practice one is enriching the soul by directing the energies of universe and natural elements such as wind, water, earth, metals to it.\n\nIt is so important to stay positive and constantly filled with good, flowing energy. If you do so, your life and all the things you are surrounded by will represent such wonderful qualities as health, happiness, prosperity, love and contentment.\n\nAs you know, one of the principles of Feng Shui is that Chi flows through all objects in a space, and each item that is present in or around your home has some effect on whether Chi moves freely or gets clogged up and the same principles apply to your bed room also.\n\nFeng Shui believes all types of energies on the earth fall in two opposite categories, yin and yang. Once you understand this you can understand the logic behind the best Feng Shui bed room tip offered here.\n\nBedroom is a place where you spend 1/3 of your time so having proper balance of yin and yang is very essential, some yang energy is essential, because it helps you stay motivated get going with your day-to-day chores but too much yang on the other hand can drive you nuts! It can make you feel chaotic, frenzied and over-stimulated. It can make you feel too passionate, so that you can never just sit back and relax in your bed room.\n\nA command position for your bed room in Feng Shui means that you face the door from the far side of the room but are not directly in front of the door. The part of the room diagonally farthest from the entry offers the best Command Position for your bed, it is this position, you are able to benefit from the Chi that enters and flows through the space, while being far enough removed from the doorway that you are not exposed to Chi that is too strong.\n\nAnother Feng Shui bed room tip is that you keep your beds in a position that provides a solid wall behind you for support. Using this position puts you in visual command of the space, and allows you to face life directly, both literally and symbolically.\n\nSleeping in line with the door also exposes you to excessive Chi, which can contribute to stress, irritability and health problems, but keeping your bed in commanding position prevents you from negative influences and puts you in control of your space and of your life.\n\nAnother Feng Shui bed room tip that I would like to mention about is that never keep your working desk or computer in your bedroom. The logic behind this Feng Shui tip is that the energy of computer (work) and that of rest (bed) are opposite to each other and are therefore incompatible to each other. But in case you cannot avoid this combination you can at least separate the two by using Feng Shui Elements.\n\nAs discussed earlier that Feng Shui tips are universal in nature they are applicable to each space or area as discussed in the article on Feng Shui Bagua and the logic behind each Feng Shui tip remains the same. Take for example the Feng Shui bed room tip that advises you not to keep your bed where there is window behind but ideally it should be on your right. The logic behind this Feng Shui tip is to receive the positive energies from the universe when you get up and start a new day.\n\nThough on the outset you may think these to be fairly simple Feng Shui bed room tips, but in reality these tips have strong spiritual or scientific foundation. For example, placing your desk with your back to a large window does not go well with Feng Shui and to think practically working at a computer in this position may be problem because of the glare from the window.\n\nThere can be many more Feng Shui bed room tips that can be offered. You can also make use of Feng Shui Color and Feng Shui Elements for balancing yin and yang of your bed room. Like making use of red pillows or changing the color of your bed room curtains, but for that you need to consider many other factors also.\n\nAvoid the overhead beams, the low side of a slanted ceiling, sharp angles from interior corners, and an overhead fan in a room with a low ceiling are some of the common Feng Shui bed room tips that you can find in any Feng Shui book or web site.\n\nIf interested in some exclusive information on Feng Shui ?

Isn’t that where we all end up when we consider our God, His creation, the works of His mighty hand?\n\nI once had an office mate at work with whom I did this wondering out loud. One day I was talking about one thing in particular that I wondered about when she suddenly burst out with, “Bill, you just wonder TOO MUCH!”\n\nToo much? Such a thought had never crossed my mind before! Am I not supposed to wonder, or had I crossed some maximum threshold and boldly gone where no man had gone before?\n\nI console myself with a line I once read or heard which, unfortunately, I can’t attribute to any learned source– either secular or Biblical. It goes something like, “The highest state to which man can ascend is a state of wonder.” Sounds good to me, and certainly gives credence to my natural tendency to speculate.\n\nOf course, I’ve used the word wonder in two ways here: to express curiosity, which is where I start, and to be marveled and astonished, which is where I end up each time. But thinking about our God and His creation; how He works and has worked; what the promise of eternal life in His presence does give us cause to wonder. How awesome is our God!\n\n(Okay, I used the word awesome–which I try not to do, but if it can’t be used in this instance when CAN it be used?)\n\nAnd to get from that first “curiosity” to that final “astonishment” doesn’t always require thinking about the “nature of the universe” or “what will Heaven be like?”, either. It’s not even necessary for me to look at creation or miracles to attain that state. It happens when I consider His nature—His grace, His forgiveness, and His incredible love. I can get there in a flash when I think about His love for me.\n\nConsider the story of the prodigal son (Luke 15:11-32). If you want to get yourself in a state of awe concerning God, I challenge you to read that story again and then really meditate on what’s going on there. The father is waiting and watching for the son to return. When the son is sighted, the father RUNS to greet him. The father pays no attention to the son’s explanations and suggestions. The son is welcomed back as if from the dead. How awesome is our God who would do that with us! And consider the father’s expression of love toward the son who did not wander but who also did not realize who he already was and what he always had.\n\nI’ve read this story many times, heard many sermons and other references to it and yet, when I read it again and really meditate on it I’m blown away.\n\nThere’s another song from Watermark I want to share with you. It speaks of God’s great love, how we often take it for granted, and how it strikes us again and again each time we realize we have “No Idea” how great is His love for us right now nor how it will be to stand in His presence and see Him face to face. Look at the lyrics below.\n\nNo Idea (by Christy Nockels of Watermark)\n\nGod so holy and true\n\nI am captured by You\n\nAnd all of the things You do\n\nThings too wonderful for me\n\nThings that set this heart free\n\nIt’s all such a mystery\n\nOh, God, sometimes it’s like I see it\n\nFor the first time\n\nOh God, sometimes I realize…\n\nThat I really have no idea, no idea\n\nIt feels like coming home every time I’m near You\n\nNo idea, no idea\n\nYours is a love so true and amazing\n\nThere’s so much of You\n\nI really have no idea.\n\nAnd when I think about the day\n\nWhen all else will fade away\n\nWhere are the words to say?\n\nIs there a way to describe looking in Your eyes?\n\nWhen I see the mystery, oh God,\n\nCan’t imagine seeing You for the first time\n\nOh God, I know I’ll realize\n\nThat I really have no idea, no idea\n\nGreat is the love that’s given me forever\n\nNo idea, no idea\n\nYours is a love so true and amazing\n\nThere’s so much of You I really have no idea\n\nNo idea, no idea\n\nYou know I can’t comprehend You\n\nOr fully understand\n\nBut I trust Your heart\n\nYou’re who You say You are\n\nI believe I believe with all that is in me\n\nNo idea, no idea\n\nIt feels like coming home every time I’m near you\n\nNo idea, no idea\n\nGreat is the love that’s given me forever\n\nI really have no idea, no idea, no idea\n\nYours is a love so true and amazing\n\nPractice His presence today.

The world over, scientists seem to be engrossed in their pedantic debates about the fact that Astrology isn’t even a form of science directly opposing the traditional view which thinks otherwise, people in general really don’t care much about it.\n\nAstrology has humble and ancient roots and is has always believed to have an element of “occult” to it. Humans have, for a long time now, wanted to take a peek into the future, to know what is coming, to foresee things and Astrology seems to be the only thing that comes close to satiating this queer little need of ours.\n\nWhether it is boxed into the “Science” category or a ‘Pseudoscience” category, it so happens that it had never failed to enthrall people by its sheer power of looking ahead into the future.

The impact of the planetary motions on our day to day lives cannot be entirely ruled out. Millions of successful users of astrology will vouch for that.\n\nFor most normal human beings, marriage is a sacred institution. It means the union of two hearts, minds, bodies, and souls. It is often said that “marriages are made in heaven”. Well, could be very much true. But for all practical purposes, it is essential to find the right match for a man or a woman. Astrology can help do just that. Astrology plays a big part in finding the right matrimonial alliance. With the help of astrological predictions, the compatibility of a couple can be ascertained. This practice of matching horoscopes of would be brides and grooms are quite common among the Hindus in India. Marriages almost never happen here without horoscope matching. Astrologers also determine the ideal time and date of the marriage. Horoscopes of the prospective brides and grooms tell a lot about the past, present and future. Horoscope matching also guides the astrologer on the dates to be avoided. There are some periods in which influence of some planets like Saturn is quite strong. These periods may not be ideal for solemnization of a marriage. Marriages solemnized in these “bad patches” may not last long, or may be shaky. So, we can say astrology can be used to avoid future “break-ups” or divorces. Matrimonial matching by horoscopes requires a few important documents. First of all, the horoscopes of both the bride and the bridegroom are analyzed. Then some crucial information such as the date of birth, time of birth and place of birth, of both the man and the woman are collected. There are various permutations and combinations to be done to match the horoscopes. The influences of the motions of the planets at the time of birth are analyzed. This gives a rough idea to the astrologer whether the couple is compatible or not. It is not mandatory that the horoscopes of the bride and the groom need to match perfectly. Sometimes marriages are possible in the case minor differences between the boy and the girl. But in such cases, some corrective measures, as suggested by the astrologers have to be taken before the solemnization of the marriage.\n\nIt has been observed that the success rates of marriages are higher in cases where horoscope matching is done. Critics may have a different opinion regarding this. But they too cannot totally disprove the fact that Astrology is effective when it comes to marriages. The scientists may say that Astrology has no scientific basis.

Most of it originates from very deep levels of Mind. Pause when you feel the need to do so when something seems a bit obscure, and meditate on it. All we easily reveal itself. It is meant to.\n\n\n\nThe Universal Mind (The IS: Eternal Intelligence-Awareness) always tries to teach its entities of thought about Its reality and their purpose, through the medium of creative inspiration. However if, because of the resistance and creative misconceptions that mankind introduces, the perception is that this cannot be achieved within illusory frameworks of time and space, which defines periods within Creations, then these particular Creations just disappear and are devibrated in the swirling of the real Black Hole of the Mind.\n\nWe are nearing such a crossroad in this Creation.\n\nMost human entities spend their “waking” lives hypnotized by their sensory world, which gives them the illusion of a material reality “out there.”\n\nIn reality, space and time are really nonexistent both at the level of Pure Aware Consciousness, and also at the level of the unaware “blind parts” that experience for It the illusion of creative thought within an illusory space/time construct called Creation.\n\nMankind rarely realizes that life is but a sensory illusion that gives experience and learning to Thought, and that the only reality is Thought Itself, which is forever evolving.\n\nConsciousness can be defined as Awareness projected onto a vibratory Dream. Period. For Space/Time Creation it is but pure Dark lesser vibratory (conscious and subconscious) thought interacting more or less intensely with the inner Holographic Light/Thought Reality originating through the facets of The MATRIX (“Deep” of Genesis 1: 2).\n\nBEING means BE-IN-God. Not the reverse, which is impossible.\n\nOur purpose in life is BE-IN-G, RE-MEMBER-ING, and ultimately EN-JOY-ING the Godliness.\n\nTo be HAPPY and smile at our inner Higher Self.\n\nThe only real Space there is, is the mental Space within the DreamSpace (Imag-in-ation) of the Mind of God. The only real Time there is, is the pace of the evolvement of God’s Awareness within Its Dream through the media of Vibratory Light, as God projects Its Consciousness onto Its own Vibratory Dream (The Matrix).\n\nThe Matrix of life is projected and connected to each perceptual individual consciousness through a Thought/Supercomputer (The Matrix) that interacts with its sensory input/output individual computer (brain).\n\nThe Matrix is really a field of pure information, not energy. It underlies and structures all energetic processes. As such it cannot yet be detected by our instruments. It is really the realm of the mythic ether (implicate realm) that physicists know should exist but has not yet been experimentally detected.\n\nConsciousness provides the energy of life.\n\nOriginal Consciousness has an unfathomable number of connections to the General Thought/Supercomputer. Each connection will be projected for a perceptual lifetime into a story/creation thinking that it is a particular character experiencing a particular life, surrounded by particular entities and reality within an illusory space/time Holographic Virtual Reality. The Creation and the individual will be given a certain history of linearly coherent perceptual history and a sense of possible probable futures.\n\nAll we are is but wonder-full Holograms of pure light, interfacing with Creative thought, who believe in a material reality because our senses fool us, by the rules of The Matrix, The Matrix reloaded, into perceiving that a solid world exists “out there.” Where, in reality, none of the sort is real. No Real solid ever existed, exists, nor will ever exist. We cannot go through a wall because we are not allowed to do so, by the original rules of the computerized thinking Matrix ruled by Original Thought: Infinite Intelligence Itself. The wall is hollow, we are all hollow. Light is but hollow. This is all it can be. All the rest is a Grand Illusion created by the Original Mind!\n\nThe construct to The Matrix of life is pure light and the modulating factor is information/thought. As a matter of fact all light is, is vibratory thought. like what we create when we dream. Vibratory light is light vibrated by sound, manifesting as the material/biological world as it is decoded by our brains.\n\nEach connection of Original Consciousness (Awareness) is therefore projected into an individual Holographic Virtual Reality world which the General Thought Supercomputer will coordinate with other connections of Awareness/Thought that interact with the same virtual reality movie (Creation). The ultimate Cosmic virtual reality sensory video game played by the One Mind!\n\nLife is but the Eternal (Original Awareness-Consciousness) experiencing the temporal realm, for learning purposes.\n\nEach grouping of connections (perceptual consciousnesses) that connects to a shared general story will define a separate Universe/Creation.\n\nThere are myriads of such Universes/Creations operating simultaneously within Original Consciousness, up to a potential infinity.\n\nEach one can have a totally different construct of operational rules, and system of creative input/output (Matrices). Many operate within visual (Space/Time) realities of many models and creative dimensions. Others operate within other sensory realms, or even as pure abstract thought.\n\nOriginal Awareness is the One that fashions all these multiple systems of Creation. It IS totally unlimited in scope of intelligence and potential Awareness. It is only through tremendous restriction of Its Awareness, Intelligence and Capabilities, that It can experience surprises within the trip of the return of Its parts to the total realization of being Original Awareness.\n\nThis is the only evolution that really is and operates. This is the impetus/direction and creative force of the Universe. The return of the parts of the IS (children) to the IS (Original Father/Mother). Anything that impedes this natural flow, must ultimately be intervened upon.\n\nOur Universe is composed of extremely restricted Awarenesses (consciousnesses). It is considered to be a very experimental and dangerous Creation because within its original concept the degree of induced amnesia is maximum, the intentionally created and forever evolving misconceptions intense, and the degree of very High (closer to Original Awareness) intervention very rare, often undetected, and few-in between. So far.\n\nIn this Universe, the Creative challenge to evolve is very high and difficult. It is therefore considered to be a very high school of learning for the Mind in Its desire to ever evolve Itself into higher expressions of Itself.\n\nOriginal Awareness is always aware of all of its parts plugged into the Virtual Reality Game of Life called Creation. No matter how perceptually restricted they are. It knows that they are but Itself. All of them. Without any exception.\n\nCertain parts of Original Awareness plug into the awareness of a whole creation and its sub-parts at once (and the sub-parts hence become direct children of their awareness/consciousness) and can therefore be considered to have either a passive role (witnessing/monitoring) and/or often an active Creational input (intervention) at the level of a whole creation. They can be called the Creator/Creators of a particular Universe (The Matrix operators), or the Overseer(s), depending on how active their role is.\n\nHigher unrestricted parts of Original Awareness plug into groupings of Creations that operate under an umbrella of similar operational rules and therefore become Creators of a grouping of Universes.\n\nWithin a grouping of universes, certain universes may, if they are ready and allowed to, interface more or less covertly with other universe, in order to learn from them and probe if they can exploit their creative knowledge or resources to further their evolution. This can only be done with the knowledge of the overseers of the grouping of Universes they belong to, and obviously of Original Mind (Awareness). Sometimes, as in all endeavors, Original Awareness allows for the unfolding of the intermixing of these different parts of its Mind to study the outcome. Sometimes, if the intent is negative (against real Creative evolution), it might interfere with it.\n\nOriginal (total) Awareness is the ultimate arbitrator.\n\nEach connection of General Awareness to the General Virtual Reality Supercomputer therefore defines and plays out for a lifetime a particular role/character and thinks of itself as a separated Consciousness – no matter how high and creatively powerful it is, or low and operationally restricted it gets.\n\nThe learning is in the experiencing and the decision-making process.\n\nOur creation operates by the interference of thought/waves.\n\nOur Holographic Reality is created and projected through the creative interference of two thought waves.\n\nFirst, the original reference beam of pure unadulterated extremely Vibratory Original Light/thought. The Inner Sun (“Big Light” of Genesis) who Is the original energy/star that gives life and reality to all and is the carrier wave of thought/information to all of us as awarenesses experiencing virtual reality.\n\nSecond, the modulation of this original reference beam of pure light by our thoughts, as perceptual human individuals, operating within the creative framework allowed by the mirroring of our intentions over the silvery reflection (Inner Moon: “Small Light” of Genesis) of the interface of the original intent of the All-that-Is and the MATRIX of Creational possibilities allowed to us.\n\nIn reality, consciousness (awareness) never moves nor goes anywhere. It only connects to each other and to the projection of virtual realities. When an individual thinks that he/she is moving, in reality the scenery moves within a 3D holographic sensory imagery and allows for the perception of Movement, and Space, to be given within a sequence of events perceived as Time. A Universe is only as big as one’s perceptions of it goes, either directly, through direct interaction or indirectly, through sharing the same story.\n\nEach individuation of Total Awareness is the still center of its ever changing bubble/universe of Creative Awareness/Reality.\n\nIt is through the connective interaction of such individual Centers of Original Awareness that a General Universe/ Creation unfolds.\n\nAs in the Holographic Dream that we perceive and that our scientists study, space/time as a 3D Universe exists only and always within the confines of Eternal Non-space/time. This is but a metaphor to the Only Reality who is always outside space and outside time as Thought-AWARENESS.\n\nAs a matter of fact, time and space never really exists, nor existed. Consciousness as a restricted part of Original Awareness experience reality within the illusory impression of a spatial reality “out there” operating within sequential stories giving an illusion of time. All life is but Consciousness as restricted Awareness (Spirit) experiencing a human or other life form. Nothing else. And certainly not the reverse.\n\nNothing can possibly exist outside of one’s TOTAL Self. The illusory “There” is really “Here.” Think that you are “There”, and you become aware of being the “There.”\n\nReality (physical universe), as the Universal Spatial Hologram that we perceive as material reality, is but an outward 3D virtual reality projection from within ourselves that we will erroneously think exists independently of our awareness of it. We are both the Projector (Father) and the Spectator (Son) of the reflected Light or our common intent mirrored back onto our conscious Awareness.\n\nOur sensory decoding and information processing apparatus (brain) only addresses the decoding of the feedback of the reflected light (input) made by our restricted creative choices within the virtual reality game of “life.” We are usually not made aware of being also the originator (output) of that Light and projection of reality. For the purpose of increasing the challenge of the game and its sense of being “real.”\n\nOne cannot but be stricken with awe at the incredible Intelligence, Beauty and Creativity of the One Mind forming the illusory Many. As part of the illusory Many, our role is to nurture and cherish the wonderful gift of creative expression of Creation.\n\nThis 3D Holographically engendered movie is run by The Matrix. This Matrix is neither static, nor permanent. It can and should be exchanged for a higher-level Matrix (operational reality) where more creative input (powers) and freedom are allowed to be given.\n\nThis decision can only be made either by the Creator of a grouping of related Creations operating the Mainframe of a Grouping of Matrices, or Original Awareness: The ONE.\n\nAny part of consciousness can become the totality of It (Original Awareness) by unplugging from the restricted awareness of its Matrix, become all-aware and then choosing a different mode of creative operation as it plugs into a different Thought-Computer program (The Matrix).\n\nThis action is often opposed by the mass consciousness that operates that low-level Matrix (Collective Unconscious of Mankind). Fearing a loss of control and decrease in the power of Its battery of massive energy/consciousness.\n\nThe unplugging from a lower-level MATRIX to a higher level one is always monitored by higher levels (Creators) of the Original Awareness and is only given if the awarenesses that define a creation show a higher purpose of being and co-operative inclination. Otherwise these powers of Creative Thought could be misused irresponsibly and be counter-productive.\n\nThe ultimate hope and goal is to be able to operate within the “promised land” of the highest level Matrix of all: The Matrix of Perfection bestowed as a precious gift by Zion (The One).\n\nA low-level MATRIX such as ours requires a high level of coordination and thought/intervention by the Creator(s) of the individual Universe who experiences it and coordinates it. The Creator of that Matrix often feels that in order to ensure the continuity of the experience of that Matrix by its unaware sub-parts, It is required to think for them and act for them without them being aware of it. Since that Creator’s only task is to monitor and coordinate a Creation for the Original Awareness, It will make sure that it carries this role for as long as possible, and lives for as long as possible. Hopefully for eternity. That Creator might feel that this ensures their survival as a Creation and Itself, in the process. Primitive-level matrices often cause great distress and fear/anxiety at all levels. Both at the level of the Creator who gets frustrated at the destructive behavior of its entities and therefore feels that It needs to closely monitor them and often think for them, and also at the level of Its very restricted unaware parts that remain in a state of unaware dependence, subject to what they will perceive to be luck or fate.\n\nThis self-perpetuating bondage is, for low-level Creations, very hard to break as it is often perpetuated by both the sub-parts (humans) and the Creator (Collective Unconscious) of that Creation.\n\nThe sub-parts (humans) often fear change because they lack an awareness of their real origin and creative possibilities. Faced with so many unknowns in life and questions about its purpose, they gladly relinquish control as long as their basic sensory needs are satisfied. They relish being told by others what to think and how to act. They lack an awareness of how potentially powerful their thoughts are and how Creation operates. All of their thought orientations conglomerate around group-consciousnesses that emphasize competition and mistrust in their political, economical, ethnical, religious, and national agendas. Much remains unknown, and existential questions are often relegated to that category and given superficial answers that satisfy most. They think of their reality as the only reality. At all levels. Fear is the consequence and becomes the great motivator. Overcoming fear by experiencing it is a constant obsession. Paranoia and violence often ensue, and power, greed, lies, mistrust and a lack of care seem to be favored.\n\nThe sum of their consciousnesses who as their general Higher Self (Collective Unconscious) is their Creator (the part of their common self having the awareness of all of them and their matrix) often gets very frustrated at the constant intervention that is required in order to keep the elements of Its Creation alive an operating.\n\nIt gets tired of taking care for so long of what It perceives to be irresponsible children of his thoughts. It often does not perceive any real evolution in their thought processes no matter what technology they are given.\n\nIn the meantime, since It is aware of all of them at once, they influence It and It influences them in the flow of thought that defines the Creation. It finds the necessity of trying to keep them disciplined and alive a paramount task.\n\nAny human entity that is yet not unplugged from its present collective unconscious is potentially subject to the thought-directions of mass consciousness. To real mind control.\n\nThe Creator in this Creation, as in most low-level Creations, has sadly learned to violently and strongly oppose rare human visionaries that have seen the real reality beyond the Matrix and have wanted to share the knowledge with others, because, in all cases, their teachings have been distorted by Its human entities and have caused even more violence, sense of illusory superiority and righteousness amongst their followers, and become excuses for ever greater differentiation and aggression. It knows, sadly, that in our Creation, the messenger will be given far more importance and study than the Message, nullifying its purpose.\n\nIt knows that in order to be given more Creative leeway and freedom of thought (free choice) i.e. a higher matrix in Creation, one must relinquish control over one’s entities. It knows that Its entities are not yet ready to handle such high powers of thought-manifestation without endangering their survival and the survival of their Universe/Creation. It witnessed how as It transmitted, within The MATRIX of possibilities that he operates, high creational technological abilities to Its entities, they tried to convert them for destructive purposes and war-play, even endangering the entire survivability of this whole Creation. Up to the point where It, as the Creator of this Creation, had to directly intervene on a thought-to-thought basis in order to stop their potential total destruction – in what mankind perceived to be miraculous events rapidly unfolding – and control Its entities that were engaged in an illogical perverse death-wish.\n\nIts current frustrations have to do with a even more pernicious threat. The destruction by Its entities of their environment and sustainability in the extremely complex and fragile equilibrium that man and nature have in common. Nature being the nurturing female complementary element of mankind. This requires constant monitoring, intervention and hope for a new matrix that will permit the reversal of the long-term damage that has already been inflicted upon the Being that a Creation represents. It is as if mankind had turned into a cancerous cell, joyously ravishing the Central organism that keeps It alive in a orgy of unlimited greed and desire for ever-increasing irresponsible growth.\n\nThis Creator dreams of a more advanced type of Creation for Its Entities and Its entire Creation. As much more aware and unrestricted Thought, It knows that many more advanced type of Matrices exist and can be given at any time by higher level creators to lower ones such as It. It knows that because of the very low-level of almost ingrained behavior of Its entities, the likelihood of this occurring soon is quite remote. Unless a miracle happens.\n\nEven if It creates better scenarios and more freedom of action for Its entities and a semi-perfect world, which It has tested before, they seem to reject the gift and prefer a world of violence and power-play. And It waits, and waits, with extreme frustration and anger. Directed both at Its unaware entities for their primitive behavior, and at the Higher realms for refusing to give It more Creative abilities. Trying to keep a semblance of balance within very restrictive and dangerous natural laws of cause-and-effect that threaten the survival of Its entire Creation.\n\nThe key, for the individuals forming a Creation and ultimately for the totality of that Creation as their Collective Unconscious (Creator), to being offered a higher-level Matrix that incorporates much more freedom of action and thought-manifestations (Creative Powers), is to be willing to let go of their sense of egotistic desires (Ego) and care more about the evolution of Creation than about their individual realities. To show forth that behavior pattern of caring for the perceived “other” – no matter how perceivably evolved or not – above and beyond caring for one’s self. For the “other” is none but your self.\n\nTo be willing to die in perception in their current form of operation in order to be granted a higher form of operation.\n\nTo understand, integrate and learn that one’s Universe is within one’s self and that if you really understand the tremendous power that your individual and common thoughts have in manifesting reality, you then have power over all your reality and can manifest all your desires. If you reach the state of the total absence of fear by believing with full faith and experiencing that you are ultimately the Original One Mind, you automatically erase from your reality all fearful situations.\n\nTo show forth an understanding that all forms of life are but a restricted awareness and experience of the Original One Mind and that Mind (Awareness) cares as much about any Part of Itself than about any other. Since it is All but Itself. And experiences all of Itself. Each Part as much as the other. So that when one part is hurt, neglected, and lacked the respect of its real importance, the One Mind is feeling this hurt, neglect and disrespect. And when a part is feeling a sense of peace, happiness, abundance and cooperative purpose, all of the One Mind is feeling the same. And every part of Itself is as important and precious as another, no matter whether it is part of mankind or nature, within the hologram or without, whether it is of a particular creed, color, or political inclination. Perceptually more productive and intelligent, or less. No part is more of Itself than another one. Since all of It is only the One Mind reflecting Itself in the mirror of all Its creational possibilities for the only game It can play within Itself, by Itself, for Itself: Creation.',NULL,674,'4',0,0,7,'2021-07-29',NULL,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,'2021-07-29 09:10:41','2021-12-01 16:32:18'),(196,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0.00,'25','1','Belief Opinion Pride Expectation','None of us can predict the future, but we can choose which paths that we take.

The intimate touch of another soul is the most powerful antidote for the all-too-human experience of aloneness. It may be the most compelling and pleasurable experience there is.\n\nSo why do we spend so much of our time and energy avoiding intimacy by defending ourselves, being angry, critical, closed and judgmental – in short, blocking the experience that we most deeply want?\n\nDEFENDING THE EGO GETS IN THE WAY OF LOVE.\n\nThe answer is that we are wired to constantly reinforce our limited ego-based identity, our sense of who we are.\n\nThis ego-based identity plays a very important role in human life, but it does not have the power to love. Ego is all about the self. It can and does experience need, and need is often easy to mistake for love. And it can certainly love how another person makes it feel.\n\nBut these things aren’t true love. True love and intimacy doesn’t come from the ego. In order to experience the power of true love you have to get in touch with a different part of yourself – the part that lies beyond ego.\n\nTHE TRUE NATURE OF EGO.\n\nThis process is easier when you understand the true nature of your ego-based identity: It doesn’t really exist.\n\nAlthough it functions as if it’s the most real thing about you, in actual fact your ‘identity’ is only a perspective. It’s kept alive solely through the stories you tell yourself about life, others and yourself.\n\nYou could literally say that your ego is all talk – an incessant monologue whose sole purpose is to reinforce your sense of self – who you are and who you aren’t.\n\nMost of the time it goes something like this: “I’m better than he is, uglier than she is, smarter than him, richer than her, worse than I should be. I can do this, I could never do this, I shouldn’t have done that, they shouldn’t be that way. Life is good, life is hard, he’s right, she’s wrong, I’m great, I’m no good, it’s my fault, it’s their fault…” and on, and on, and on…\n\nJust as a whale identifies its location through bouncing sound waves off nearby objects, your ego pinpoints its own presence – defines itself – by relating to the people, ideas, and objects around it.\n\nThis process is continuous. Your identity must be continuously reinforced or you will quite literally lose the sense of who you are.\n\nThat’s why it can be so very threatening to have something or somebody confronting your ego – your beliefs about yourself, others or the world. Since the ego is actually made out of these beliefs, perspectives and opinions, and you identify the ego as ‘you’, when your beliefs are threatened it can feel just like a threat to your very survival.\n\nQuite simply, the more you get to be ‘right’ about things, the more real and solid you feel, and the more you have to be ‘wrong’, the more threatened and diminished.\n\nWHO ARE YOU REALLY?\n\nThis would be really bad news if not for the fact that there is another part of you. This part – your core essence, your authentic self – has an intrinsic reality. Unlike your ego-based identity, its existence is not dependent upon outside circumstances or stories. And unlike your ego, it’s not threatened by someone else’s success, or enhanced by their failure. In fact, the opposite is true.\n\nYou could visualize your ego/identity as like the surface of the ocean; changeable, vulnerable, reflecting the sun, sky, and clouds, affected by every wind. Your core is the vast, calm, still, deep water beneath. Those deep mysterious waters teem with every kind of life and potential, but this life is invisible from the surface.\n\nAll transformation involves a process of seeing beneath the changeable surface and connecting with the vast deep life-giving waters beneath. This process usually involves a level of discomfort as your identity is shaken out of its placid solid form and made to expand and reflect a deeper level of reality.\n\nBut it’s worth it.\n\nMY LITTLE WAKE-UP CALL\n\nLast year I had a very typical experience from which I learned an uncommon lesson.\n\nI was upstairs in my bedroom. My husband was late getting home and had failed to call me to let me know. I wasn’t really worried about him, but I still began to get more and more agitated by the fact that he hadn’t come home when he said he would.\n\nThe later he become, the angrier I grew. By the time I finally heard the door downstairs I was in a fury. (I realize that this doesn’t show me in a particularly positive light – but the truth is, that’s exactly what happened.)\n\nLike a balloon inflating with hot air, I got ready to blow up at him.\n\nBut then something happened. In a moment of unusual lucidity, I saw the future before my eyes. This is what it looked like:\n\nFirst, I’d blow up. I’d express some righteous indignation (in a loud voice). I’d persist until my husband (generally a pretty nice, easy-going guy) admitted that his behavior had been rude and inconsiderate. Then, once my anger was properly validated, I’d forgive him and we could be friends again – but only after I’d temporarily diminished his ego and inflated my own.\n\nIn that one lucid moment I realized that I could simply skip the whole thing and go straight to being authentic and close. I saw a new possibility – the possibility of refusing to be a slave to my own ego. To choose from a deeper, calmer, more authentic part of myself.\n\nI was overwhelmed with a sense of how massively stupid, predictable, automatic and ridiculous this whole pattern actually is.\n\nWhat part of me saw that new possibility? The part that peeked out through the surface of my ego – a little piece of my core.\n\nEGO AND PURPOSE – THE STAGES OF CREATION\n\nThe world was created in three basic stages.\n\nIn Stage One, G-d’s* Infinite all-pervasive essential light was shining without limit, filling all space. There was no place devoid of it, and therefore nothing could exist aside from it. This is the stage of Infinity.\n\nIn Stage Two, G-d concealed His Infinite light in order to create an apparently ‘empty space’ in which other things (i.e., the universe, us) could exist. This concealment of the truth is Stage Two. This is the stage of the finite, where it became possible for myriad creatures and myriad perspectives, each with its own limited boundaries and parameters, to exist.\n\nStage Three is the merging of infinite and finite. It involves the transformation of the finite inhabitants of the universe. They must move from a state of being which conceals their infinite Divine Source to one which expresses and reveals it.\n\nLike a game of hide and seek, G-d conceals Himself in our finite world and waits for us to find Him. Through this process He can endow us with the greatest gift there is – to exist as finite individuals and yet experience a truly intimate relationship with our Creator.\n\nYour ego is central to this process.\n\nLike everything in the physical world, your ego hides the light of your essence. It is what allows you exist as a separate individual. By blocking out your intrinsic connection to\n\nG-d, your true nature and purpose, and the essential oneness of the universe, your ego allows you to function as an individual. It allows you to have a personal perspective and a personal experience of life. Without it you’d be simply a part of the whole.\n\nBut this is only the beginning the process. The ultimate goal is that through your ego – your role as a limited individual with a limited perspective, you will find your way back home.\n\nHOW IT WORKS\n\nWe have entered the Era of Transformation. This means that you can train your ego-based identity to recognize and align itself with the voice of your authentic self. The ego doesn’t have to be defended or suppressed – it can be transformed. Your ego can be used on behalf of the purpose for which it was created in the first place – to allow you to enhance your relationship with your Creator, express the potential of your essence, and fulfill your purpose here on earth.\n\nYour defensive ego-based reactions will probably not go away for now. But instead of being a slave to them, you can use them as the impetus to connect to these deeper parts of you. The moment you choose to observe yourself rather than react, to question your own defensive instincts, to genuinely see another person’s point of view, to admit where you may be wrong, to connect with something higher, to be generous with your time, money or resources when you don’t have to, you have made your ego your ally.\n\nIn fact, whenever you choose use your body, your mind, your time, your relationships or your possessions to fulfill your authentic purpose – to do something intrinsically good or G-dly – those things, for that moment, are Holy. They have been used on behalf of the purpose of Creation. You have created a bit of light through which the world’s darkness and concealment will be transformed.\n\n*Since the Torah forbids the erasing of G-d’s name, it’s customary to avoid writing it out in full.',NULL,579,'4',0,0,4,'2021-07-29',NULL,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,'2021-07-29 09:34:15','2021-07-31 21:34:03'),(199,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0.00,'25','1','Why Is Spiritual Truth So Elusive','Why is spiritual truth so elusive? Why is it that matters of spiritual significance are so hard to verify and validate?\n\nI have been pondering hard on this subject for quite sometime. And these are my conclusions.\n\nSpiritual truth is so elusive possibly because of several factors. They are as listed below:\n\n1. Many seekers are using the wrong modes of seeking. What do I mean by this? Firstly we try to relate and uncover spiritual truth and reality with our own thinking faculty. This will lead us to nowhere because spiritual reality is what is encapsulating our limited thinking faculty. Spiritual reality is in a way ‘beyond’ the normal thinking mode assigned by a personality/self. No offence, but most people are doing this precisely. As such believers can ONLY believe and NOT experience divine spiritual reality.\n\nMy first experiences of Divine Consciousness were during meditation sessions. Very significantly, during these meditations, thoughts and thinking were much reduced. In a state of no thought (Yes and I mean not a single thought!), we will experience ourselves clearly as an all-pervading Presence. It is during these moments that one discover that the world and ourselves is not what it appears to be. And we suddenly understand what the ancients Sages from various traditions were talking about.\n\n2. Being conditioned by societies’ beliefs. Our upbringing very much demarcated what should be real and what’s not. And this is supported by a very convincing structure based on scientific proving and visual/experiential validation.\n\nLet me illustrate this point further… Since childhood, education and adults have been telling us what is correct and what is not. We all have been brainwashed to think like one another. As such our sense of identity has been influenced by our fed information and beliefs. Do you know that prior to any acquired learning, a child relates to the world very differently? Much of how we perceive the world is learnt… and is fundamentally different from our natural way of referencing. However, learnt ways are certainly not negative; it is just that modern societal influences tend to suppress and discourage certain in-born cognitive abilities such as intuitive clairvoyance. And intuitiveness is a necessary ingredient for efficient spiritual navigation.\n\n3. We think we know it all. When we think we know it all. The thought of ‘I know it all’ will block us from knowing anything deeply. Why this that so? Because a ‘know-it-all’ will not seek to know deeply and therefore will not go deep enough…\n\nWell, in a nutshell, these are my findings.',NULL,163,'4',0,0,0,'2021-07-29',NULL,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,'2021-07-29 09:37:22','2021-07-29 15:02:24'),(200,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0.00,'25','1','Feng Shui Study','Feng Shui is relevant to any body.

What ever school you might consider for your Feng Shui study, remember the basic principles and theories (Feng Shui elements, concept of yin and yang, Feng Shui Colors ) would remain the same but there can be some variation in the tools that are used for analysis and interpretations.\n\nThe following information provides you a brief introduction to various schools of Feng Shui:\n\nFlying Star Feng Shui\n\nFlying Star or Xuan Kong Feng Shui is the most advanced level of Feng Shui study, it adds a time dimension to a building’s energy. The advanced Compass School also integrates the Eight House Theory to provide a comprehensive &amp; professional analysis of a house.\n\nFeng Shui study under this school enables you to predict the good times and the bad times from year to year, month to month and day -to-day based which are based on the natal or the birth day chart of each house.\n\nFeng Shui consultant of this school suggests enhancements for every home after a complete Feng Shui study is made to know how the nine different “stars” or energies are moving or flying to different compass directions every year, month, day and hour. Base Charts of all nine periods are constructed based on the study. The residents’ dates of birth are also taken into account. The school also gives consideration to the form as it affects the stars.\n\nCompass School Feng Shui\n\nCompass School divides the structure into the eight compass directions using a lo pan compass. Each person has four good compass directions and four bad compass directions which are based on their year of birth and gender, the person either belongs to either the East Group or the West Group. A building’s sitting direction determines whether it is an East or West Group structure. Each compass direction has a Feng Shui element associated with it: water, wood, earth, metal, or fire. A Feng Shui consultant who is proponent of this school suggests best compass directions for sleeping and working which can tremendous affect for improving your life.\n\nForm School Feng Shui\n\nUnder the ‘The Form School of Feng Shui’ one makes a systematic Feng Shui study to understand how the shapes and forms of the surrounding landscape and waterways affect people living or working in a structure. The four cardinal directions of the compass are represented by four animals which are the Green Dragon of the East, the White Tiger of the West, the Red Phoenix of the South and the Black Turtle of the North. Interior forms and the layout of the structure are also analyzed and Feng Shui consultation is made by understanding the many implications of the color.\n\nWestern Feng Shui/BTB (Black Hat Sect Tibetan Buddhist)/Pyramid\n\nThis is a modern version of Feng Shui developed in the mid 1980s and is a combination of Tibetan Buddhism, Taoism ,Psychology and Traditional Feng Shui and is based on a more spiritual approach. The structure is divided into eight sections and a bagua or Ba Gua map is aligned with the entry door, rather than actual compass directions. Each section corresponds to a different life aspiration. The Feng Shui study gives more emphasis on placing of symbols. The Feng Shui consultation also draws from modern psychology and design principles besides the ancient wisdom. Its guiding principle is that changing the subtle energetic (Chi) alignments and flows in a given space can change a situation’s inherent intention, hence changing the fate of its inhabitants.\n\nFeng Shui Study\n\nOne can go for Feng Shui study for any of the Feng Shui School mentioned above in a distance learning mode. There are available many certified continuing education providers on the internet.\n\nThe Feng Shui study helps you to have deep and clear understanding of the energetics of environment; discovering how to begin balancing and positively activating energy in your working and living environments.

A great amount of dogma too has been kicked around in an attempt to make us into better people. Magick (the occult kind, spelled with a ‘k’) is one of the oldest and most general of these systems. Magick is the study and application of psychic forces. It uses mental training, concentration, and a system of symbols to program the mind. The purpose of magick is to alter the self and the environment according to the will.\n\nMost of the magick we see today comes to us from ancient Egypt and Chaldea. The Chinese, Hindus, and Tibetans developed their own unique types of magick.\n\nWestern magick was locked up by the Egyptian priests for thousands of years and then suppressed by the rise of Christianity. It was not until medieval Europe that the alchemists and Cabalists rediscovered magical knowledge. Only during the past hundred years or so has western culture been open minded enough to permit widespread investigation of the subject. Only since the start of the twentieth century has science shown much interest in it al all.\n\nParapsychology and Psychic Phenomena\n\n\n\nThrough parapsychology, we are gaining insights into the hidden nature of man. Parapsychology is a branch of psychology, which studies psychic phenomena. It remains something of a frontier, even today. Perhaps one reason for this is that psychic phenomena are somewhat inconsistent. Nevertheless, there is strong evidence from numerous cases and experiments in support of psychic phenomena. Somehow, under the right conditions, the mind can directly affect the environment.\n\n\n\nWe may theorize that the human mind and body broadcasts a kind of psychic energy or force, much like a radio station. Kirlian photography, temperature effects, cloud chamber tests, and other experiments tend to support this theory. Although the exact nature of this psychic force is subtle and unknown, it is undoubtedly the energy behind all psychic phenomena and magick. However, it is not a radio wave, since it behaves somewhat differently. The psychic force is too weak to be measured directly (at least so far as we know). Everyone has some psychic ability. There are numerous types of psychic phenomena. Parapsychology separates them into two groups: ESP and PK.\n\nWhat is ESP?\n\nESP, the abbreviation for extra sensory perception, means the reception of information through paranormal means (ie. not regular physical senses of sight, sound, touch, smell, or taste). In theory, this is accomplished by receiving psychic force from outside the body. Here are some examples of ESP:\n\nClairvoyance, or Remote Viewing — the ability to sense or ‘see’ (non-physically) distant objects, places, and people. Individuals who see ghosts and spirits are probably clairvoyant.\n\nClairaudience, or remote hearing — the ‘hearing’ of paranormal information.\n\nAstral Projection (OOBE) or Travelling Clairvoyance — Full experience at a remote location while the physical body sleeps.\n\nPsychometry — the reading of information by the touch of physical objects.\n\nTelepathic receiver — the ability to directly receive thought (communication) at a distance, with no physical connection to the sender. There are many everyday examples of this, in which we think something just as another person is about to say it. This is an easy one to test for through experiment. Very dramatic cases of telepathy have been recorded; there is often an emotional element in such cases.\n\nA ‘channel’ or medium, as in a science who is in direct communication with a ‘spirit’ or entity.\n\nExperience with a Ouija board, pendulum, or automatic writing.\n\nPrecognition — to foresee the future. Again, highly emotional events are the ones most likely to be ‘tuned in’.\n\nRetrocognition — knowledge of the past, by paranormal means.\n\nWhat is PK?\n\nPK, the abbreviation for psychokinesis, is the active or sending side of psychic phenomena. The theory here is that psychic force is sent out from the individual. Examples of PK include:\n\nTelepathic sender — the transmitter in the telepathy just discussed.\n\nPsychokinesis (or telekinesis) proper — the ability to move objects by means of psychic force.\n\nSomewhat along the same lines are poltergeist (noisy ghost) phenomena in which objects move of their own accord or noises are heard. There is always a human agent involved — frequently a teenage girl — who appears to be the source of psychic energy.\n\nPsychic healing — the ability to heal various illnesses and infirmities. There are many documented cases of this. Usually it involves a healer and a subject, although there are recent cases involving cancer patients learning to heal themselves.\n\nTeleportation, asportation, and levitation.\n\nSome occultists feel a magician producing PK effects is simply a channel for universal energy. Others think the force originates some way directly within the magician.\n\nThe Subconscious\n\n\n\nPostulated by Freud and others, the concept of the subconscious mind is an important one.

You can use them as “operating principles.” Calling them lies refers top the fact that we essentially pretend to believe what we have no real evidence for. It is time for an example from the true events of the day.\n\nUseful Lie Nuber One – Everything Happens For Reason\n\nThis morning I was on the highway by four thirty, heading out of Canon City to climb Mount Yale. It is important to start early, in order to be off the summit before the afternoon thunderstorms move in. As I was approaching Salida, I saw a scattering of rocks on the road, which had fallen during the night, and it was too late to avoid them.\n\nThe front driver’s side tire was immediately punctured by a rock and was losing its air. I pulled off the highway and took a look. It was completely flat. I opened the trunk, and the first thing I noticed was that everything was wet. Apparently the trunk had been leaking when it rained. Then I saw that the bolt holding the jack in place was rusted. I tried turning the nut with no luck. I took the crowbar and pounded on it, but it wouldn’t budge.\n\nFor a break, I moved everything into the car, so I could get at the spare tire under the trunk carpet. The wing-nut holding it in place was also rusted solidly in place, and couldn’t be pounded free. It must be a test of my ingenuity, and a chance to practice my creative problem solving skills, I decided (useful lies?). I tried using a rock, managing only to crush my finger. This was an opportunity to dance around, and practice my profanity.\n\nI remembered that in a box of miscellaneous tools in the trunk there was a small hacksaw, with a four-inch blade. Kicking and stepping on the jack had only bent the metal brackets, so I decided to saw through the bolt. The saw broke. I was able to fix it, and I made it through the bolt, but when I took the jack out, it wouldn’t work. It was all rusted up. I found some oil in the trunk and dripped it on the threads of the jack, then pounded on it with the crowbar. It moved, and I was finally able to use it.\n\nI washed in the river, enjoyed the rising sun, then started on the much thicker bolt holding the spare tire in place. of course the saw broke, I fixed it, the saw jammed, I started over, and eventually, the tire was free. I wiped off the slime that was growing on it. Soon I had the other tire off, the spare on, and was listening to it leak air. It wenjt flat. Good thing I had a bicycle tire pump. Mission accomplished, no problem.\n\nI arrived at the tire shop in Salida at seven. It opened at eight. I waited the hour, then discovered that the tire was beyond hope, got a new tire put on, and… it was too late to go climb the mountain. It also was raining. It would have been an awful day to be up high on a rocky peak. Perhaps I even would have been seriously hurt had it not been for that flat tire.\n\nDo I believe that? No, I don’t even believe that everything happens for a reason. I don’t have to, you see. Acting as if that’s the way life works is enough. I could have been discouraged, pissed off, or in an otherwise unproductive state. Instead I acted as though things really do happen for a reason.\n\nWhat does this do for you? It changes your perspective. It gets you thinking about what good comes from a “bad” situation. I was having fun trying to figure out how to change that tire, and I avoided a cold wet hike. Then I came home and I wrote this article, which might even bring new traffic to my web site. In other words, I made a good thing out of a bad thing. That is what useful lies can do for you.',NULL,253,'4',0,0,2,'2021-07-15',NULL,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,'2021-07-29 10:05:56','2021-07-31 19:39:45'),(204,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0.00,'25','1','City Of Peace East Meets West The Dream Of The Spiritual Is Ra El','The One Integrated Spirit (IS) as the spiritual IS-Ra-EL (Zion: The Core of the Universal Mind) has been trying desperately to unify His children (all the individuals of mankind) around the perception of One-ness for the length of this Creation, always hoping to gather them from their exile from Himself. sHe has made a protective connection for the third time in the history of this Creation between the Eternally unified JeruShalem (The One: Unity Itself) above and the manifested earthly JeruShalem (ancient Hebrew name for Jerusalem) of the City below, as the capital of an earthly IS-Ra-El, in an attempt to manifest the Holy of Holies of unity, love, and kindness, within the inner and outer Dream of this Creation. In that act he desires to project a sense of unified completion and perfection as Shalem (completion in unity, perfection, and peace in Hebrew) as the individual self reunites with the totality of the Universal Self, feeling within and expressing without the Peace of God manifested as outer peace (Shalom in Hebrew and Salaam in Arabic).\n\nThere can be no real outer peace without this inner process of unification.\n\nThis is the third and final trial at setting a permanent point of connection between the Heavenly Zion and its manifestation in Creation as mankind through the JeruShalem below. The hope is that the battling children of Abraham will reunite and see themselves as the brothers they really are, originating all from the same Soul, and that this unity will then pervade the rest of the One soul, the One mind, operating as Mankind. The eternal battle in the Mind between the tendency to unify and the tendency to divide is being epitomized within Zion and its symbolic connection as the earthly JeruShalem, drawing the full focus of the world’s attention. This is not a coincidence. Real Power originates from concentrating upon the notion of the One and upon the One – upon the notion of integration, unity, brotherhood, and its manifestation as love. All other forms of competitive separation and man-made power structures are but mere illusion allowed to operate, for a while, within the shadows expressing darkness. At the level of the One, might does not rule, only truth does.\n\nThe heavenly archetype being played out here is in the expression and realization of the real Divine protection and strength provided when the focus of attention is on the concept of unity around the Original Unmanifested Truth: The One, and Its hopes for reconciliation and peace within all of Its sacred parts. It opposes the concept of Ego (Gog) based division, elitism, and transient man-made power. It transcends the restricted awareness of organized and tinted worshiping systems that proclaim, as they should, divine acceptance, love and unity, but often project misguidedly fear, hatred and violent intolerance of others, up to now. The One Life force that flows into all of us would never call for recognition at the expense of other parts of Itself. Only man could miscomprehend and misdirect.\n\nWere the symbolic unity of the earthly JeruShalem be compromised in any which way (and there are many desperate and feverish attempts within this Matrix to do so now), the connection between the Heavenly realm and the earthly one would be irreversibly damaged and severed, and this whole Creation would sadly enter again a new dark age of unsupervised destruction and suffering, possibly culminating in its total devibration from the One Mind within the next century.\n\nThe One, the Holy One, promises His land to whomever He deems worthy of it. We cannot own the Real Estate of the One (Earth). We are only entitled to a lease on it. The Earth was and is His, and as such we should respect, cherish and be the responsible stewards of this sacred gift. It is His decision to bestow it to whomever sHe chooses, and for how long as sHe chooses.\n\nSo it is for Israel, and so it is and will be shown very soon for all the inhabitants of this planet Earth. Israel is only His first and symbolic case in point.\n\nAll of the Land on Earth will soon only be a “promised land” to whomever sHe chooses to hand it over to. No human government or body will make that decision. The Earth will focus Her infinite power and fury against the children that have pillaged, wounded, and deeply violated Her in their quest for power, strife and ownership of Her freely bestowed resources. Without thanksgiving. Without consideration for the One Life force flowing into all and everything. Dangerously threatening the sustaining balance that sHe tries to maintain for this and all future generations.\n\nThe One forms the many that remain nevertheless but One. The many do not form the One. At the level of the many, fear and separation always manifest somehow as long as Creation and the notion of two is manifested within the Unmanifest (One). In our case, greatly so. The primary source of evil is in the mistaken belief that Source does not care about fear (expressed within this very shadowy Creation as a strong tendency to separate from, forcibly exclude and control) and is only remotely experimenting on-line and then analyzing/learning afterwards. This ultimate misinformation given to the many, as a test, in order to have them believe that they have total free will and will not be interfered is about to be undone-in a big way.\n\nSource can allow Itself to have free will too. sHe never went into forced retirement or nothingness for eons of time, even though man seems to want to believe so and impose his accepted versions and interpretations of representation.\n\nIn order for the shadow (mankind) to believe that it was the total master of its fate and the Gods of its Creation, Light had to allow darkness to express its power and believe in the misconception of it being able to repel Light- for a very long dark period. Nevertheless, in the end, all Light has to do is light up the abode, and darkness disappears in the reunification of the One. One way or another.\n\nThis is the answer. See things in an inverted way. From One into the many. Not reversed. The One Awareness cannot be unaware. Otherwise, the parts that It takes away concentration from just disappear from within the recesses of Its Creative Imagination.\n\nThere is very much the hope that all of mankind will soon be able to rejoin the feeling of completion and real inner peace that the merging with Higher Self will bring as the notion of The One is experienced at all levels. And that, consequently, outer peace and abundance will eternally be manifested to all, without exception, when a portal to the higher “Matrix,”: The Matrix of Zion, with more Creative free will and less restrictive bondage, will be opened to the remnant gathered chosen ones that have integrated this mode of thinking, and they will all enter this new Eternal Promised Land of “The One” where joy and peace will reign for eternity.',NULL,446,'4',0,0,1,'2021-07-29',NULL,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,'2021-07-29 10:11:43','2021-08-16 20:40:25'),(206,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0.00,'25','1','The Truth About Magic Spells Real Cures Or Mind Over Matter','For many thousands of years, civilizations all over the world have relied on their faith in spiritual or mystical powers to accomplish truly amazing feats. Long before modern medicine came on the scene, most health concerns were traditionally handled by applying a dose of spirituality, voodoo, witchcraft, astrology, or psychic power from any number of paranormal sources. One simply couldn’t get through the day without help from the “unseen” world. Of course, that was in the “dark ages” before we were enlightened by the miracles of modern science. But is it wise for people today to scoff at all that seemed to work for so many people, for so long?\n\nIn a world where mainstream religion is often mocked, it’s so easy to laugh at those believe in the powers of the paranormal, occult, magic, psychic or new age remedies. We often label them as misguided kooks or blind followers of today’s trendy Hollywood scene and counter-culture. But as humans, it is built into our composition to search for truth, and solutions to the many problems we face. And let’s face it, today’s world is filled with day-to-day problems that we strive to overcome… issues dealing with love, money, health, just to name a few. Life is a difficult struggle for millions of people worldwide who seek relief, and solutions to their problems by turning to magic spells. Just go to Ebay and do search on love spells or magic spells. You’ll find an endless potpourri of psychics and spell casters who can make your problems disappear, or bring you amazing results for just a few dollars. Think that’s funny? It gets better. When asked, most people who buy these spells will tell you that they really work… and they do.\n\nSo how can a love spell performed by a psychic actually attract a soulmate to a lonely person seeking a love partner? Did that money spell really make that struggling secretary get a job promotion and a salary raise? And what about that healing spell that cured my neighbor’s back pain? The unbelievers will likely point to coincidence, some sort of logical explanation, or attribute the results to simply “mind over matter.” But those who believe in psychic powers and the paranormal world think otherwise – there must be a spiritual or metaphysical helping hand involved.\n\nAs a self-professed psychic and paranormal expert, who has studied spirituality, psychic phenomena, and the art of spell casting, I personally believe that there is much more to this than meets the eye. Most mainstream religions accept the power of prayer as a way to receive blessings, protection and goodness from spiritual sources. Even medical professionals are now recognizing that an individual’s faith and beliefs can play a major role in improving quality of life and health. However, while many doctors will admit that there is some benefit to holistic and alternative medicines, you’ll be pressed to find any who will publicly encourage seeking answers from a psychic or magic spell.\n\nThere has always been, and will always be a stigma in going to a fortune teller, psychic or spell caster that keeps people from easily accepting their virtues. As an industry, the psychic business has brought on much of this skepticism itself. Shoddy late night television infomercials for psychic readings, con artists or carnival fortune tellers are the images that come to mind for many, when they think of psychics. Just look at how astrology and other psychic-related ads have that tiny disclaimer at the bottom that says “for entertainment purposes only.” It’s about as phony as pro wrestling, right? Well, don’t be too quick to agree.\n\nThere are more people than you think who use money or love spells on a regular basis, in an attempt to restore a bad relationship, or gain financial freedom. And these are folks from all walks or life, professions, income levels, religious affiliations and nationalities. Sure, some may rely too much on seeking guidance and help from the psychic world, but most of them are die-hard believers of the occult and would not have it any other way. They will tell you that these spells work for them, their lives have been enriched, and you are the foolish one who chooses to miss out on something wonderful.\n\nPeople always ask me, “Are these spells real? I mean, can they actually make things happen that I can’t do on my own?” If spells can do what they claim they can do (improve love life, attract more money, better luck at gambling) then the answer has to be “Yes.” A spell that does what it is supposed to do has got to be real. Of course, it helps if you have a positive outlook, and believe that the spell can truly help you. But if the spell delivers results, then it has to be real. Believers will tell you that those who refuse to open their minds to the possibilities of magic spells and spiritual solutions will never know what they are missing. Perhaps it is the unbelievers who are experiencing “mind over matter,” only their mindset is narrowly fixed on the opposite end of the belief scale.\n\nWhy limit your world to just the few things you can see and touch?

During the following months (during my grieving period) after spending several hours in non-stop prayer about the situation, The Lord took me back (in my mind) to the day I was in the hospital holding the lifeless child in my arms.\n\nHe revealed to me: The way I felt for this lifeless child, was the same way He felt for us (his children).\n\nDuring this prayer, (I call it a prayer, but it was more like: I was flat on my face sobbing to the point I couldn’t speak) So in my spirit I poured my heart out to God and told him:\n\n“God, when I whispered in the baby’s ears, she couldn’t hear me. When I spoke the words “I love you”, she never turned her head to acknowledge me. She never opened her eyes to see me. I have accumulated everything a baby needs to survive- food, clothes, shelter, toys, etc., but this means nothing right now because I will not be able to take her home with me.”\n\nThe Lord in his wisdom answered me: He made me understand He also has children that he calls out to; however, they close up their ears so they cannot hear him. They shut their eyes so they cannot see him. He provides everything for them, but they do not acknowledge Him~ they are dead in their sins. He cannot take them home with him in heaven because they are dead.\n\nThis brings me back to the original scripture, “I am convinced that neither life nor death or anything can separate us….” The Love God has, will never change, it will always be there, even in death, it is just that some people have chosen to remain dead in their sins.\n\nGod is a just God that never changes and in his word, he says that the wages of sin is death!\n\nMaybe at one time they did listen to him. They did hear His words and He grafted them into the vine, of which we are the branches. Now, if they have closed up their eyes and ears, and have returned to unbelief, He can cut them out of the vine. He cannot take them to heaven-they are dead.\n\nThe good news is God is a forgiving God.

When used in conjunction with a chart, it can be used for dowsing and divination. It can be used for the following:\n\n\n\n1. Provide Yes/No responses and answers to queries. This is similar to muscle testing or applied kinesiology.\n\n2. Provide more accurate answers to queries, such as degree, intensity or percentage.\n\n\n\nThere are commercial pendulums available on the market. Usually they can be bought from shops dealing with metaphysical or new age stuffs. However these shops are quite scarce and can be quite hard to find. Alternatively, pendulums can be ordered online through websites selling them.\n\nThis article is about making a do-it-yourself (D-I-Y) pendulum for dowsing. If you want to save some money or commercial pendulums are not available for you, you can opt to make one yourself.\n\nActually, to make a pendulum is not that difficult. We can always find substitutes for the various parts of a commercially-manufactured pendulum. The parts that need to be substituted are:\n\n\n\n1. The bob which is the weight at the lower end of a pendulum.\n\n2. The chain which connects the hand to the pendulum bob.\n\n\n\nFor the pendulum bob, we can use any reasonably weighted object. I personally, use arrow shaped pendants. In fact, the smaller-sized fishing weights can also be used. Although, I much prefer some pendants over fishing weights as they are more visually attractive than the latter. Pendants can be bought from fashion accessory stores. As for fishing weights, they can be found in large departmental stores as well as shops selling fishing equipments.\n\nFor the chain, they can be acquired from fashion accessory shops that sell necklaces and chains. Metal ones are preferred. The length of the chain should not be more than a foot. In my opinion, 1/2 to 3/4 of a foot is quite ideal.\n\nOnce we have the parts, all we need is to assemble them. At the tip of the pendant or fishing weight is usually a loop or ring. We need to hook one end of the chain through the ring (or loop) at the tip of the pendulum bob (which is either a pendant or fishing weight).\n\nNormally, most chains are made up of many little metallic rings. To assemble the pendulum, we may need to pry open one of the metallic rings (at one end of the chain) and insert the loop/ring of the pendulum bob through it. After that, we will need to re-adjust the metallic ring (on the chain) back to its original closed-looped position. A long-nose plier is most suitable for doing these fine handiworks.\n\nThat’s all to making a pendulum for dowsing. Quite simple, isn’t it!\n\nI hope this article is useful.

Palmistry is also called as chiromancy, palm-reading, chirology, or hand-analysis. Palmistry originated in ancient India. It was said to be practiced by the Brahmins of Ancient India. Palmistry can be regarded as a part of Astrology. Records of practice of Palmistry are also available in countries such as China, Tibet, Persia, Mesopotamia, Egypt, and Ancient Greece.\n\nCheiro was the most famous practitioner of palmistry in modern times. He was born in Ireland and had predicted many incidents of his time. For example, he correctly foretold the Boer War, death of Queen Victoria, assassination of King Umberto of Italy, a year or so before each of these incidents occurred. He also had predicted about the infamous “Great Depression” all over the world. He correctly predicted the outbreak and end of World War 1 before it happened. Cheiro wrote a number of valuable books on Palmistry. He had also successfully predicted the downfall of the Czar in Russian and the subsequent massacre of him and all his immediate family members. Palmistry is based on reading the lines on the hand of a person. Palmists say that by reading the lines of a person’s hand, it is quite possible to tell about the persons past, present and future. They say that positioning of the lines in the hand is a key to determining the subjects past, present, and future. The basics of Palmistry are said to be quite simple as opposed to the popular belief that it is something mysterious. The fleshy part of the hand and the structure of the fingers reveal a lot about the subject. Palmists claim that predictions through Palmistry has scientific basis, even though the scientists worldwide have their own opinion regarding this topic. The scientists claim that Palmistry does not have any scientific basis. According to the Palmists, the dominant hand of a person reveals the current and future trends. On the other hand, the passive hand reveals the person’s childhood. Palmists see a definite pattern in the lines on the palm. These lines have been classified into heart line, head line, life line, fate line etc. Each of these lines will interpret different aspects of ones life.\n\nIn this age of cutthroat competition, the people seem to have become more and more dependant on things beyond their normal powers. Palmistry is gaining popularity even among the western public as well. This is because human beings have become more concerned about their future than ever before. Palmistry is quite popular in India. It is a part of the everyday life for many Indians. Life is unimaginable for them without Palmistry. They will consult the Palmist for almost every activity of their lives. For special occasions like marriage, setting up of a new business, birth of a child, starting a new profession etc, a visit to a Palmist has become a must. A palmist will examine the hand carefully and advice the clients about their next activity.

He thinks this guy is really fat; therefore he must be living a very fortunate life. Whether the fat guy is really living a fortunate life, we will never know. But to Alex, it is true at the moment he conjures the ‘judgement’.\n\nMy opinion is that all impressions and judgements are personal and from oneself. The ‘external’ is just the way it is. The external is really not directly related to the thoughts that arise within us. The thoughts that arise are interpretations of the ‘external’. Therefore all judgments must originate from within oneself. When we dislike someone, do we really dislike the person or are we disliking the image of the person that arises in the mind?\n\nMetaphysically speaking, we see that each one of us is just consciousness self-awaring of ourself! This is quite abstract and hard to explain. The individual points of self-awareness’s interpretation of the external are ‘tinted’ with the habitual patterns that were inherent. We (the consciousnesses) see through our own lenses of habitual conditioning.\n\nAn example to illustrate the habitual influences:\n\nWhen viewing a single object, three individuals will have 3 different views/interpretations. But none of the views is the TRUTH. They only reflect images of the TRUTH.\n\nSo… what allows ‘points of awareness/consciousness’ within an environment or world to ‘understanding’ one another?

It is a book of faith written by people who had undergone a transforming spiritual experience or who believed they had “seen” their God at work in their history. By “transforming” I mean an inward turning-around: things/ideas/values that were not important to you now are; those that were of great significance now aren’t.\n\nBiblical people tried, as best they could, to put that experience into words, just as I tried to tell the story of my own spiritual transformation in my book, How the Bible became the Bible (Chapter 9). Trying to tell that story, I learned that it is very difficult to verbalize or communicate deeply personal spiritual transformations. Regardless how I crafted, reshaped, and eventually reworked my verbiage, my soul still felt as if I had missed the mark.\n\nAt the same time I also know if I tell my wife: “Honey, I’ll love you ’til the moon turns blue,” it doesn’t mean that I think the moon has turned blue before or will turn blue sometime in the future.

If they didn’t understand any of that, they could very well conclude I believed the moon had (or could) turn blue. So, why is it when we read statements like this in the Bible, we think we have to believe them literally? We understand poetry and song lyrics. These kinds of words evoke imagery – “… ’til the moon turns blue.” It is the same with the Psalms, for example. Verses in the Book of Psalms were written as praises or songs to be recited, chanted, or sung at temple festivals.

You might as well lay this book aside and stop right here as to approach this lesson with the feeling that it was written by some long-haired theorist who had never tested the principles upon which the lesson is based.\n\nSurely this is no age for the skeptic, because it is an age in which we have seen more of Nature’s laws uncovered and harnessed than had been discovered in all past history of the human race. Within three decades we have witnessed the mastery of the air; we have explored the ocean; we have all but annihilated distances on the earth; we have harnessed the lightning and made it turn the wheels of industry; we have made seven blades of grass grow where but one grew before; we have instantaneous communication between the nations of the world. Truly, this is an age of illumination and unfoldment, but we have as yet barely scratched the surface of knowledge. However, when we shall have unlocked the gate that leads to the secret power which is stored up within us it will bring us knowledge that will make all past discoveries pale into oblivion by comparison.\n\nThought is the most highly organized form of energy known to man, and this is an age of experimentation and research that is sure to bring us into greater understanding of that mysterious force called thought, which reposes within us. We have already found out enough about the human mind to know that a man may throw off the accumulated effects of a thousand generations of fear, through the aid of the principle of Auto-suggestion. We have already discovered the fact that fear is the chief reason for poverty and failure and misery that takes on a thousand different forms. We have already discovered the fact that the man who masters fear may march on to successful achievement in practically any undertaking, despite all efforts to defeat him.\n\nThe development of self-confidence starts with the elimination of this demon called fear, which sits upon a man’s shoulder and whispers into his ear, “You can’t do it – you are afraid to try – you are afraid of public opinion – you are afraid that you will fail – you are afraid you have not the ability.”\n\nThis fear demon is getting into close quarters. Science has found a deadly weapon with which to put it to flight, and this lesson on self-confidence has brought you this weapon for use in your battle with the world-old enemy of progress, fear.\n\nTHE SIX BASIC FEARS OF MANKIND: Every person falls heir to the influence of six basic fears. Under these six fears may be listed the lesser fears. The six basic or major fears are here enumerated and the sources from which they are believed to have grown are described.\n\nThe six basic fears are:\n\na The fear of Poverty\n\nb The fear of Old Age\n\nc The fear of Criticism\n\nd The fear of Loss of Love of Someone.\n\ne The fear of Ill Health\n\nf The fear of Death.\n\nStudy the list, then take inventory of your own fears and ascertain under which of the six headings you can classify them.\n\nEvery human being who has reached the age of understanding is bound down, to some extent, by one or more of these six basic fears. As the first step in the elimination of these six evils let us examine the sources from whence we inherited them.\n\nPHYSICAL AND SOCIAL HEREDITY\n\nAll that man is, both physically and mentally, he came by through two forms of heredity. One is known as physical heredity and the other is called social heredity.\n\nThrough the law of physical heredity man has slowly evolved from the amoeba (a single-cell animal form), through stages of development corresponding to all the known animal forms now on this earth, including those which are known to have existed but which are now extinct.\n\nEvery generation through which man has passed has added to his nature something of the traits, habits and physical appearance of that generation. Man’s physical inheritance, therefore, is a heterogeneous collection of many habits and physical forms.\n\nThere seems little, if any, doubt that while the six basic fears of man could not have been inherited through physical heredity (these six basic fears being mental states of mind and therefore not capable of transmission through physical heredity), it is obvious that through physical heredity a most favorable lodging place for these six fears has been provided.\n\nFor example, it is a well known fact that the whole process of physical evolution is based upon death, destruction, pain and cruelty; that the elements of the soil of the earth find transportation, in their upward climb through evolution, based upon the death of one form of life in order that another and higher form may subsist. All vegetation lives by “eating” the elements of the soil and the elements of the air. All forms of animal life live by “eating” some other and weaker form, or some form of vegetation.\n\nThe cells of all vegetation have a very high order of intelligence. The cells of all animal life likewise have a very high order of intelligence.\n\nUndoubtedly the animal cells of a fish have learned, out of bitter experience, that the group of animal cells known as a fish hawk are to be greatly feared.\n\nBy reason of the fact that many animal forms (including that of most men) live by eating the smaller and weaker animals, the “cell intelligence” of these animals which enter into and become a part of man brings with it the FEAR growing out of their experience in having been eaten alive.\n\nThis theory may seem to be far-fetched, and in fact it may not be true, but it is at least a logical theory if it is nothing more. The author makes no particular point of this theory, nor does he insist that it accounts for any of the six basic fears. There is another, and a much better explanation of the source of these fears, which we will proceed to examine, beginning with a description of social heredity.\n\nBy far the most important part of man’s make-up comes to him through the law of social heredity, this term having reference to the methods by which one generation imposes upon the minds of the generation under its immediate control the superstitions, beliefs, legends and ideas which it, in turn, inherited from the generation preceding.\n\nThe term “social heredity” should be understood to mean any and all sources through which a person acquires knowledge, such as schooling of religious and all other natures; reading, word of mouth conversation, story telling and all manner of thought inspiration coming from what is generally accepted as one’s “personal experiences.”\n\nThrough the operation of the law of social heredity anyone having control of the mind of a child may, through intense teaching, plant in that child’s mind any idea, whether false or true, in such a manner that the child accepts it as true and it becomes as much a part of the child’s personality as any cell or organ of its physical body (and just as hard to change in its nature).\n\nREMEMBER that when you make an appointment with another person you assume the responsibility of punctuality, and that you have not the right to be a single minute late.\n\nIt is through the law of social heredity that the religionist plants in the child mind dogmas and creeds and religious ceremonies too numerous to describe, holding those ideas before that mind until the mind accepts them and forever seals them as a part of its irrevocable belief.\n\nThe mind of a child which has not come into the age of general understanding, during an average period covering, let us say, the first two years of its life, is plastic, open, clean and free. Any idea planted in such a mind by one in whom the child has confidence takes root and grows, so to speak, in such a manner that it never can be eradicated or wiped out, no matter how opposed to logic or reason that idea may be.\n\nMany religionists claim that they can so deeply implant the tenets of their religion in the mind of a child that there never can be room in that mind for any other religion, either in whole or in part. The claims are not greatly overdrawn.\n\nWith this explanation of the manner in which the law of social heredity operates the student will be ready to examine the sources from which man inherits the six basic fears. Moreover, any student (except those who have not yet grown big enough to examine truth that steps upon the “pet corns” of their own superstitions) may check the soundness of the principle of social heredity as it is here applied to the six basic fears, without going outside of his or her own personal experiences.\n\nFortunately, practically the entire mass of evidence submitted in this lesson is of such a nature that all who sincerely seek the truth may ascertain, for themselves, whether the evidence is sound or not.\n\nFor the moment at least, lay aside your prejudices and preconceived ideas (you may always go back and pick them up again, you know) while we study the origin and nature of man’s Six Worst Enemies, the six basic fears, beginning with:\n\nTHE FEAR OF POVERTY: It requires courage to tell the truth about the origin of this fear, and still greater courage, perhaps, to accept the truth after it has been told. The fear of poverty grew out of man’s inherited tendency to prey upon his fellow man economically. Nearly all forms of lower animals have instinct but appear not to have the power to reason and think; therefore, they prey upon one another physically. Man, with his superior sense of intuition, thought and reason, does not eat his fellow men bodily; he gets more satisfaction out of eating them FINANCIALLY!\n\nOf all the ages of the world of which we know anything, the age in which we live seems to be the age of money worship. A man is considered less than the dust of the earth unless he can display a fat bank account. Nothing brings man so much suffering and humiliation as does POVERTY. No wonder man FEARS poverty. Through a long line of inherited experiences with the man-animal man has learned, for certain, that this animal cannot always be trusted where matters of money and other evidences of earthly possessions are concerned.\n\nMany marriages have their beginning (and oftentimes their ending) solely on the basis of the wealth possessed by one or both of the contracting parties.\n\nIt is no wonder that the divorce courts are busy!\n\n“Society” could quite properly be spelled “$ociety,” because it is inseparably associated with the dollar mark. So eager is man to possess wealth that he will acquire it in whatever manner he can; through legal methods, if possible, through other methods if necessary.\n\nThe fear of poverty is a terrible thing!\n\nA man may commit murder, engage in robbery, rape and all other manner of violation of the rights of others and still regain a high station in the minds of his fellow men, PROVIDING always that he does not lose his wealth. Poverty, therefore, is a crime-an unforgivable sin, as it were.\n\nNo wonder man fears it!\n\nEvery statute book in the world bears evidence that the fear of poverty is one of the six basic fears of mankind, for in every such book of laws may be found various and sundry laws intended to protect the weak from the strong. To spend time trying to prove either that the fear of poverty is one of man’s inherited fears, or that this fear has its origin in man’s nature to cheat his fellow man, would be similar to trying to prove that three times two are six. Obviously no man would ever fear poverty if he had any grounds for trusting his fellow men, for there is food and shelter and raiment and luxury of every nature sufficient for the needs of every person on earth, and all these blessings would be enjoyed by every person except for the swinish habit that man has of trying to push all the other “swine” out of the trough, even after he has all and more than he needs.\n\nThe second of the six basic fears with which man is bound is:\n\nTHE FEAR OF OLD AGE: In the main this fear grows out of two sources. First, the thought that Old Age may bring with it POVERTY. Secondly, and by far the most common source of origin, from false and cruel sectarian teachings which have been so well mixed with “fire and brimstone” and with “purgatories” and other bogies that human beings have learned to fear Old Age because it meant the approach of another, and possibly a much more HORRIBLE, world than this one which is known to be bad enough.\n\nIn the basic fear of Old Age man has two very sound reasons for his apprehension: the one growing out of distrust of his fellow men who may seize whatever worldly goods he may possess, and the other arising from the terrible pictures of the world to come which were deeply planted in his mind, through the law of social heredity, long before he came into possession of that mind.\n\nIs it any wonder that man fears the approach of Old Age?\n\nThe third of the six basic fears is:\n\nTHE FEAR OF CRITICISM: Just how man acquired this basic fear it would be hard, if not impossible, definitely to determine, but one thing is certain, he has it in well developed form.\n\nSome believe that this fear made its appearance in the mind of man about the time that politics came into existence. Others believe its source can be traced no further than the first meeting of an organization of females known as a “Woman’s Club.” Still another school of humorists charges the origin to the contents of the Holy Bible, whose pages abound with some very vitriolic and violent forms of criticism. If the latter claim is correct, and those who believe literally all they find in the Bible are not mistaken, then God is responsible for man’s inherent fear of Criticism, because God caused the Bible to be written.\n\nThis author, being neither a humorist nor a “prophet,” but just an ordinary workaday type of person, is inclined to attribute the basic fear of Criticism to that part of man’s inherited nature which prompts him not only to take away his fellow man’s goods and wares, but to justify his action by CRITICISM of his fellow man’s character.\n\nThe fear of Criticism takes on many different forms, the majority of which are petty and trivial in nature, even to the extent of being childish in the extreme.\n\nBald-headed men, for example, are bald for no other reason than their fear of Criticism. Heads become bald because of the protection of hats with tight fitting bands which cut off the circulation at the roots of the hair. Men wear hats, not because they actually need them for the sake of comfort, but mainly because “everybody’s doing it,” and the individual falls in line and does it also, lest some other individual CRITICIZE him.\n\nWomen seldom have bald heads, or even thin hair, because they wear hats that are loose, the only purpose of which is to make an appearance.\n\nBut it must not be imagined that women are free from the fear of Criticism associated with hats. If any woman claims to be superior to man with reference to this fear, ask her to walk down the street wearing a hat that is one or two seasons out of style!\n\nIN every soul there has been deposited the seed of a great future, but that seed will never germinate, much less grow to maturity, except through the rendering of useful service.\n\nThe makers of all manner of clothing have not been slow to capitalize this basic fear of Criticism with which all mankind is cursed. Every season, it will be observed, the “styles” in many articles of wearing apparel change. Who establishes the “styles”? Certainly not the purchaser of clothes, but the manufacturer of clothes. Why does he change the styles so often? Obviously this change is made so that the manufacturer can sell more clothes.\n\nFor the same reason the manufacturers of automobiles (with a few rare and very sensible exceptions) change styles every season.\n\nThe manufacturer of clothing knows how the man-animal fears to wear a garment which is one season out of step with “that which they are all wearing now.”\n\nIs this not true? Does not your own experience back it up?\n\nWe have been describing the manner in which people behave under the influence of the fear of Criticism as applied to the small and petty things of life. Let us now examine human behavior under this fear when it affects people in connection with the more important matters connected with human intercourse. Take, for example, practically any person who has reached the age of “mental maturity” (from thirty-five to forty-five years of age, as a general average), and if you could read his or her mind you would find in that mind a very decided disbelief of and rebellion against most of the fables taught by the majority of the religionists.\n\nPowerful and mighty is the fear of CRITICISM!\n\nThe time was, and not so very long ago at that,when the word “infidel” meant ruin to whomsoever it was applied. It is seen, therefore, that man’s fear of CRITICISM is not without ample cause for its existence.\n\nThe fourth basic fear is that of:\n\nTHE FEAR OF LOSS OF LOVE OF SOMEONE: The source from which this fear originated needs but little description, for it is obvious that it grew out of man’s nature to steal his fellow man’s mate; or at least to take liberties with her, unknown to her rightful “lord” and master. By nature all men are polygamous, the statement of a truth which will, of course, bring denials from those who are either too old to function in a normal way sexually, or have, from some other cause, lost the contents of certain glands which are responsible for man’s tendency toward the plurality of the opposite sex.\n\nThere can be but little doubt that jealousy and all other similar forms of more or less mild dementia praecox (insanity) grew out of man’s inherited fear of the Loss of Love of Someone.\n\nOf all the “sane fools” studied by this author, that represented by a man who has become jealous of some woman, or that of a woman who has become jealous of some man, is the oddest and strangest. The author, fortunately, never had but one case of personal experience with this form of insanity, but from that experience he learned enough to justify him in stating that the fear of the Loss of Love of Someone is one of the most painful, if not in fact the most painful, of all the six basic fears. And it seems reasonable to add that this fear plays more havoc with the human mind than do any of the other six basic fears, often leading to the more violent forms of permanent insanity.\n\nThe fifth basic fear is that of:\n\nTHE FEAR OF ILL HEALTH: This fear has its origin, to considerable extent also, in the same sources from which the fears of Poverty and Old Age are derived.\n\nThe fear of Ill Health must needs be closely associated with both Poverty and Old Age, because it also leads toward the border line of “terrible worlds” of which man knows not, but of which he has heard some discomforting stories.\n\nThe author strongly suspects that those engaged in the business of selling good health methods have had considerable to do with keeping the fear of Ill Health alive in the human mind.\n\nFor longer than the record of the human race can be relied upon, the world has known of various and sundry forms of therapy and health purveyors. If a man gains his living from keeping people in good health it seems but natural that he would use every means at his command for persuading people that they needed his services. Thus, in time, it might be that people would inherit a fear of Ill Health.\n\nThe sixth and last of the six basic fears is that of:\n\nTHE FEAR OF DEATH: To many this is the worst of all the six basic fears, and the reason why it is so regarded becomes obvious to even the casual student of psychology.\n\nThe terrible pangs of fear associated with DEATH may be charged directly to religious fanaticism, the source which is more responsible for it than are all other sources combined.\n\nSo-called “heathen” are not as much afraid of DEATH as are the “civilized,” especially that portion of the civilized population which has come under the influence of theology.\n\nFor hundreds of millions of years man has been asking the still unanswered (and, it may be, the unanswerable) questions, “WHENCE?” and “WHITHER?” “Where did I come from and where am I going after death?”\n\nThe more cunning and crafty, as well as the honest but credulous, of the race have not been slow to offer the answer to these questions. In fact the answering of these questions has become one of the so-called “learned” professions, despite the fact that but little learning is required to enter this profession.\n\nWitness, now, the major source of origin of the fear of DEATH!\n\n“Come into my tent, embrace my faith, accept my dogmas (and pay my salary) and I will give you a ticket that will admit you straightway into heaven when you die,” says the leader of one form of sectarianism. “Remain out of my tent,” says this same leader, “and you will go direct to hell, where you will burn throughout eternity.”\n\nWhile, in fad, the self-appointed leader may not be able to provide safe-conduct into heaven nor, by lack of such provision, allow the unfortunate seeker after truth to descend into hell, the possibility of the latter seems so terrible that it lays hold of the mind and creates that fear of fears, the fear of DEATH!\n\nIn truth no man knows, and no man has ever known, what heaven or hell is like, or if such places exist, and this very lack of definite knowledge opens the door of the human mind to the charlatan to enter and control that mind with his stock of legerdemain and various brands of trickery, deceit and fraud.\n\nThe truth is this – nothing less and nothing more – That NO MAN KNOWS NOR HAS ANY MAN EVER KNOWN WHERE WE COME FROM AT BIRTH OR WHERE WE GO AT DEATH. Any person claiming otherwise is either deceiving himself or he is a conscious impostor who makes it a business to live without rendering service of value, through play upon the credulity of humanity.\n\nBe it said, in their behalf, however, the majority of those engaged in “selling tickets into heaven” actually believe not only that they know where heaven exists, but that their creeds and formulas will give safe passage to all who embrace them.\n\nThis belief may be summed up in one word – CREDULITY!\n\nReligious leaders, generally, make the broad, sweeping claim that the present civilization owes its existence to the work done by the churches. This author, as far as he is personally concerned, is willing to grant their claims to be correct, if, at the same time he be permitted to add that even if this claim be true the theologians haven’t a great deal of which to brag.\n\nBut, it is not – cannot be – true that civilization has grown out of the efforts of the organized churches and creeds, if by the term “civilization” is meant the uncovering of the natural laws and the many inventions to which the world is the present heir.\n\nIf the theologians wish to claim that part of civilization which has to do with man’s conduct toward his fellow man they are perfectly welcome to it, as far as this author is concerned; but, on the other hand, if they presume to gobble up the credit for all the scientific discovery of mankind the author begs leave to offer vigorous protest.',NULL,1306,'4',0,0,2,'2021-07-29',NULL,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,'2021-07-29 12:55:31','2021-08-04 19:49:36'),(214,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0.00,'25','1','Seeing Red And Other Aura Colors','Colors are important aspect of aura reading.

If you ask as to what it can do for you, it might not be much, but then , if you really wanted to change, it can be something which you can use.',NULL,135,'4',0,0,0,'2021-07-29',NULL,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,'2021-07-29 13:08:03','2021-07-29 13:09:00'),(217,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0.00,'25','1','The Law Of Attraction The Basics Part One','You might have read a lot about the Law of Attraction recently (commonly referred to as LOA in shorthand), made popular by its newest informational incarnation, The Secret. But what is it, really, and is it just so much gobble-dy gook?\n\nIn fact, LOA has been around forever, as have its proponents. People through the years have simply talked about it without using the term “Law of Attraction,” but same thing. Norman Vincent Peale did in his wildly popular book, The Power of Positive Thinking, for example. But why is it so hard to figure out, and more importantly, how do you harness it?\n\nWell, here’s the thing. To “use” it properly, you first have to understand it. So here goes, in a nutshell.\n\nFirst, most proponents of LOA do believe that you absolutely attract everything to you that happens to you, good and “bad” (although if you’ve seen even discussions on The Secret, even the so-called “experts” vary in their opinions on that to some extent, which I’ll discuss later).\n\nNow, wait. I can just see you going, “Hey! You’re nuts if you think I want to be broke (or sick, etc.)!” And yep, you’re right. I’d be nuts to think you want anything bad to be happening to you. Here’s where the confusion comes in, and here’s where I can help clear it up. If you’re attracting something to you, it doesn’t mean you want it.\n\nLet me say that again. If you’re attracting something to you, it doesn’t mean you want it. It simply means that you somehow have ingrained in you that it’s what you expect. It’s your reality.\n\nLet’s take money (or lack thereof) as an example. Let’s say you struggle to pay your rent and basic bills every month, even though you’re working really hard. Okay, let’s assume for a minute that LOA is right on and that you’re attracting this struggle to you. Does that mean you want that to be happening? Of course not. But it probably does mean that somewhere, somehow, you have ingrained within you the message of “not enough” when it comes to money. Maybe your parents were (decent, hardworking, well-meaning) people who said, “Money doesn’t grow on trees,” or, “There’s never enough to go around,” etc. If you grew up with these or similar messages and you have them ingrained in you as your reality, then somehow, for you, money is supposed to be scarce and precious. So that’s what you attract in your experiences. Money is indeed “scarce” and “precious,” and you never have enough.\n\nNow, just recognizing this fact goes a lot toward changing your “vibration,” which you hear a lot about when someone’s talking about LOA. Your vibration is just basically the “signal” you send out to the universe, and that signal attracts what it matches back to you. So if you’re always worried about and struggling with money, guess what you attract? Yep, more worry and struggle with money.\n\nSo then, does this mean you can just say, “Well, la-dee-dah, I’ll just quit worrying about money, then, and things will be fine!”? While many proponents of LOA would give a resounding “Yes!” to that answer, I would wager that for most of us, we need baby steps that will ultimately get us to that mindset.

You might want to confer with a Harvard University theological professor if you thought you would be getting a more valid answer. You may also just take a more casual approach, by just waiting for the next TV special on the subject and listen to the whole heavily opinionated body of experts. They might range from scoffers and doubters to liberals and conservatives and maybe a few crackpots and fanatics to spice the pot. You may, or may not learn anything, and you may escape sinking further into the swirling pool of confusion and uncertainty you already feel is prevailing, more likely than not you will be no more prepared than you were before.\n\nThe answers offered here are not infallible but they have a backing of over thirty five years of study, examination, revelation and hopefully a good smattering of common sense. The only other thing I can offer is my assurance that God has given me this particular calling and ministry. Whether any reader accepts the weight of these things is a matter of choice for them alone.\n\nMy choice has already been decided. First I would not dare to call God a liar. Secondly I have nothing to prove and last, but not least, it has clearly been required of me, and I must do this as sure as I must take my next breath.

Luke 12:48\n\nQuestion\n\nWhat is the single worst belief or false doctrine of all, concerning the second coming of Christ?\n\nAnswer\n\nThe single worst thing that works against sound second coming doctrine isn’t a doctrine at all. It is indifference. The business as usual lifestyle will be the chief reason millions are not fully prepared for His return, not some controversial doctrine. No one has made that clearer than Jesus. But as the days of Noe were, so shall also the coining of the Son of man be. For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking. marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, And knew not until the flood came and took them all away: so shall also the coming of the Son of man he.

It can be rather difficult and uneasy to read. But I hope to challenge the Reader to question upon what is generally being accepted as true.\n\nThe question for ponderance is this: Does our personality has free will?\n\nBelow is my findings on this very important subject. Reading it may change the way you understand yourself. Please proceed with caution!\n\nThe thoughts in our mind come and go… we can’t stop them, we can’t will them. For example: can we stop how we feel? When we are feeling sad, can we stop the sadness instantaneously? The answer is an obvious NO.\n\nOur ‘sense of self’… give us a sense of personal decision-making and action-taking ability… The ‘sense of self’ seems to be in charge of these actions and decision-making… but is this really the case?\n\nMy opinion is that the ego/personality has no personal free-will. The sense of self is caused by the impression of continuity and connectivity of thoughts that gives the impression of coherence and personal-willing. In another word, the sense of self IS the sequence of thoughts itself… that is interspersed with the intelligence that make coherent meaning of this sequence of thoughts. This can be realised within deep meditation, when the arising of thoughts are clearly perceived… In such meditation, one will discover that there is really NO observer of these thoughts. The subsequent thoughts that arise after the previous thought are the ‘observation’ of their predecessors. All these are happening at lightning-fast rate, and therefore is perceptible only under deep clarity.\n\nMy view is that only the soul/oversoul/source has free-will… because it is the state that held the impulses and intentions/desire/purpose for the incarnated personality. But, ironically… part of the soul/oversoul/source itself may not have a ‘sense of self’.\n\n‘Sense of self/ego/personality’ is only a part of the entire field of consciousness. The ‘sense of self’ is not the doer… it is part of the ‘being done’.\n\nHowever, this realisation does not imply that all in existence is fixed and static. In fact, the opposite is true. The visible (our conscious self/personality) works in partnership with the formless/invisible, in order to realise the potentials into physical manifestations. All of physical manifestation that is perceptible are in fact already ‘being accomplished.’',NULL,172,'4',0,0,2,'2021-07-29',NULL,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,'2021-07-29 13:22:20','2021-08-04 21:37:14'),(220,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0.00,'25','1','The Secret To Spiritual Success','Before you are born, you sit down with your spiritual guides (for approximately 2 years Earth time) and together you decide what lessons you need to master during this lifetime, what negative karma you need to balance, and what personality traits you will possess during this lifetime to help you to achieve your life lessons. This forms the basis of what is known as your Soul Life Blueprint.\n\nIt is over the course of hundreds of lives that you choose to master higher qualities of love, forgiveness, unconditional love, tolerance, acceptance, compassion, empathy, wisdom, and many, many more. Throughout our lives we incur karma (or negative debt) through wrong action. This must be repaid over the course of our lifetimes, and every lesson mastered, before we can free ourselves from the Earth plane, never to return. 80% of the negative energy you feel inside is residual negative energy from a past life or past lives. It is through the process of rebirth or reincarnation that you seek to release this negative energy that you carry inside of you. This negative energy resides in your body’s cell memory and subconscious mind.\n\nYou choose the circumstances that will provide you with the opportunities to learn your life lessons and to repay your karmic debt.\n\n1. You choose your parents. Choosing the right parents is important for the soul to achieve many of its life lessons, and each soul will choose parents that will challenge or teach it in someway. Sometimes it is necessary to choose a harsh or critical parent, who will challenge your internal power. You may not have stepped into your own power and need a dominant force to cause rebellion within your being, to awaken you. It may be that you chose a critical parent as a challenge to test your own self-love and acceptance of yourself. It may even be that you chose a critical parent because you yourself were highly critical of others in a past lifetime and this time you need to experience the injustice of being unfairly criticised and bullied for yourself, as well as repay the karmic debt you have incurred.\n\n2. You choose your personality, your name and your date and time of birth. Choosing your personality, your name and your date and time of birth is a precise action of your soul. Your soul is governed by astrology, or the governing forces of the planets. These planetary forces govern your personality, the way you act, and your internal desires and drives, so it is critical that your soul be born at the precise moment in time, so that you end up with the personality that your soul has chosen to learn its life lessons. Because your name, and your date and time of birth reflect your entire astrological make-up precisely, those trained in the fields of decoding astrology and numerology charts are able to provide you with an accurate and clear account of your soul purpose, your personality, your inner desires, and your karmic debt, etc. You may be wondering how it is that you choose your own name. The answer to this is simple. You psychically implant your full name into the minds of your parents who believe they have chosen your name for you.\n\n3. You choose what negative events and trauma you will encounter. In order to learn your life lessons and become stronger, you need to test yourself and overcome obstacles and often very difficult challenges that you have chosen for yourself before your were born. Hmm, you are saying, but what about free will? If we have predestined our life, what free will do we have? It is true that you have free will when you live on the Earth plane. Before you are born, you choose the many, many different variables or directions that your life could go in. And there are thousands! Your life is like a choose-your-own-adventure novel that you have chosen for yourself before birth. Together with your spiritual guides, you choose all of the possible outcomes that will enable you to fulfill your soul purpose.\n\n4. You choose the negative people who will come into your life. Every person who you encounter on your life-path is your teacher, and reveals to you what you still have yet to master. Especially those who are negative! The very thing you hate most in your enemies, those you hate or cannot stand, is usually the thing you refuse to see or recognize within yourself! These souls act as mirrors for you, and are very important beings for your growth and learning. Your enemies are usually your best or closest friends in the spiritual dimensions, and agree to challenge you on the Earth plane to help you achieve your life lessons.\n\n5. You choose the time you will be awakened spiritually. You give yourself a period of time to awaken spiritually on your own, without any help from spirit. Some choose to awaken later in life, others quite early. Before you are born you request from your Spiritual Master, that if you have not awoken to your spiritual path by the time you have set yourself, that everything that you hold close and dear is to be taken from you, so that you may deeply reflect on your life and what is important to you. This may include losing your spouse, your car, your house, your job, your reputation, your money, your security, your health, whatever is necessary for you to see what is really important to you in your life.\n\n6. Discovering your Soul Life Blueprint. Each soul has encoded in its full name and date of birth its Soul Life Blueprint, which reveals specific lessons it is seeking to master in this lifetime, what karma it is seeking to repay, the purpose of its soul this time around, and the personality type it has chosen to accomplish each of these. Understanding this important information is The Secret to Spiritual Success. Your Soul Life Blueprint will help you to awaken to your spiritual path, and is an important road-map for those already awakened to mastering their life lessons. You will begin to see why you have attracted certain types of people into your life. You will begin to see why you act in a certain way, and what negative behaviors you are here to overcome. You will begin to see how negative actions in previous lives (karma) is still affecting you in this lifetime, and what you can do to correct this and turn your life around. You will begin to see why you have p articular interests and desires, and what fears hold you back in your life.\n\nYour Soul Life Blueprint will show you how you can implement new strategies specific to you to help you master your life lessons; it will show you what internal psychological stress patterns you can expect from your personality during this lifetime; and it will show you how to work through these internal stress patterns, how to bring harmony back into your life, and how to find peace within.',NULL,404,'4',0,0,1,'2021-07-29',NULL,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,'2021-07-29 13:26:00','2021-07-31 15:18:08'),(221,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0.00,'25','1','Making The World A Better Place One Single Thread At A Time','Jesus Christ did not always answer a question about life with a religious answer. When they asked him big questions about kingdoms and religions he often pointed them to smaller and more approachable matters like helping one individual at a time. In fact Christ was constantly steering his disciples away from big earth shaking type questions. He pointed them back to the least common denominators such as love, kindness and faithfulness over the smallest responsibilities. He was less concerned with the macrocosmic than the microcosmic solutions to problems in our world.\n\nHere are a couple of examples that show how Christ called for people to re-focus on the smaller everyday matters of life. And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward. Mt 10; 42 another example would be, He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much…Lu16; 10.\n\nAnyone who has ever seen an authentic Chinese tapestry has stood in awe of the sprawling colors and designs that spread out to make a picture that dazzles the senses. A few people may take the time to get up close to the tapestry and view some of the millions of tiny stitches that go into creating the whole picture. The tapestry is more than the sum of its parts but never less than each and every single stitch.\n\nEvery person is capable of making at least one stitch with their lives. In America and other parts of our world today people who have succeeded in life are beginning to examine other areas to contribute something of value. People who have made their fortunes and have everything they have ever desired are now looking for something else to fulfill them. In almost every case the answer is being found in something outside of themselves and their own private lives and affairs. Many people are now becoming volunteers, campaigners or are joining churches and groups that contribute to individuals or communities. Giving contributions of millions of dollars is giving way to giving contributions of themselves and their time, usually to one person at a time or small groups of people less fortunate than others.\n\nEven men notice when a small deed is performed in a timely fashion. Howard Hughes, the worlds most noted billionaire, searched an entire western community to find one man who had given him a mere twenty five cents as Hughes traveled through the region without money or means. The man was rewarded by Hughes by being included in his final will with a gift that reportedly was in the millions of dollars. If men notice such deeds then don’t worry Providence is keeping the perfect record.\n\nIt is the fine almost golden threads that make up life’s expansive tapestry. Often the good done by these golden threads is just a few well timed and well placed words of kindness. Yet, there are many who say they don’t know how they could possibly know what to say, or how to say something to help others. It is probably more a matter of instinct than of intelligence. The longest diary in the world, four million words, is said to belong to the late Arthur C Benson; 24, April 1862 -17 June 1925 poet and associate of England’s College of Cambridge University. Known as a man of many words, Mr. Benson was best known for his admonition for using the fewest words when addressing human suffering or sorrow. He was a strong proponent of trusting the gut when it came to finding the right words for the right moment. He said, “I don’t think some decisions are made by the reasoning faculties, but by some instinct. One knows what one can do and what one cannot do, when the time arrives.”\n\nSometimes not even words may be required to lend a helping hand. Sharing other peoples feelings silently can be useful. This is the essence of empathy, which is feeling along with another so they are attended or not so alone in their grief, calamity or sorrow. A New Orleans man once told me a story about one of his friends who had suddenly lost his beloved wife of many years. He arrived at hospital moments after his friend got the news that his wife had passed away. He found his friend leaning against the waiting room wall and convulsing and weeping with overwhelming sorrow. Not knowing either what to do or say he instinctively responded by leaning on the same wall and crying along with his friend. Weeks later he met with his friend again and the first words he heard were, “Thank you for being there for me you will never know how much you helped me.”\n\nI had to take a short ride to town between writing this paragraph and the one before it. Sauntering back down the country road to the house I pondered what I would use as an example of a small thread of kindness. Suddenly I was waved down by a woman who seemed to be in some kind of distress. Across the road I noticed a very young man struggling to jack up his car and change a flat tire. She asked if I had a four way wrench because the one the young man, her son, was using didn’t fit. I brought him my four way wrench and a hydraulic jack I was carrying in my car and mother and son were back on the road in a matter of minutes.\n\nNaturally I thought this is an example of the small threads I was trying to write about. I dismissed it out of hand because, I reasoned, it is too insignificant. It was the word insignificant that caught my attention. Yes, it was no big deal but it was after all the very kind of small thing that makes up the big picture.\n\nOf the many genres of music that I love one is old fashioned Appalachian mountain bluegrass. After helping that young men and his mother, the chorus of one of my favorite bluegrass gospel songs entitled “By the Side of the Road” popped into my head. Let me pop it out here for you to roll around in your head. I think it is what could help the world to be a better place in a very real and practical way.\n\nI’d rather live, by the side of the road\n\nAnd try to point souls, to the blest abode\n\nThan to be a king, or a millionaire\n\nAnd live in a mansion, in bright array\n\nI’d rather do, a neighborly deed\n\nFor a traveler here, or a friend in need\n\nI’d rather live, by the side of the road\n\nAnd help some pilgrim along life’s way',NULL,358,'4',0,0,0,'2021-07-29',NULL,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,'2021-07-29 13:32:42','2021-07-31 07:55:01'),(222,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0.00,'25','1','Tarot How Often Should You Have A Reading','One of my FAQs is, “How often should I have a Tarot Card reading?” There is no general answer. It depends on your purpose – what type of reading you are having and the way you are using it. If you are looking for some indication about what is happening in general in the future, then you could have a reading every six months or so, or perhaps every year.\n\nThis kind of reading tends to involve a bigger “spread” or “layout” as Tarot readings are called, with more cards in it. This allows a broader view of trends that may be coming into play around you. It usually tells a reader whether you are in a time of change or of relative stability – whether new stuff is going to happen or things remain very similar to how they are now. You don’t need this kind of reading very frequently. It’s “big picture” stuff and tends to change slowly.\n\nIf you are looking at one issue at a time, such as if you are going to get a new job soon, you can ask that question with a smaller kind of layout. A few cards or a Celtic Cross will be fine and will tell you what the possibilities are in that situation. The reading might tell you if you need to add to your skills and head off in a new career direction or search more thoroughly for a job than you are currently doing. If you asked about moving house it might say that moving would be disruptive at this time. The Tarot is always more than just “Yes” or “No”. Usually it gives you some advice or insight as well.\n\nWith a reading based on one specific topic you can ask whenever you like as long as the topics are different. It’s no good asking the same thing many times, because the answers just become confusing and often merely reflect how you are feeling that day. I always try to discourage people from becoming dependent on divination. Asking the same question again and again, trying to “nag” the cards into telling you what you want to hear is not healthy. Sometimes life doesn’t give us what we want and we have to accept that and get on with things as best we can.\n\nIt’s better not to ask trivial questions. I have found that the Tarot works best when you’ve thought out your question carefully and put it in a sensible manner. When you have an answer to a question, then it’s a good idea to go away and reflect on it and see how that answer can help you with your problem. That is one of the strengths of the Tarot – guidance. It can help us to see solutions for ourselves.\n\nBy using the Tarot wisely, it becomes like talking to a good friend. The answers often open up new ways of looking at our lives that can help us bring out the best for ourselves in the future. Like all good friends it responds best if you take notice of the answers it gives.',NULL,163,'4',0,0,1,'2021-07-29',NULL,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,'2021-07-29 13:35:24','2021-07-31 15:33:02'),(223,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0.00,'25','1','Spirituality And Science Opposites','Do spirituality and science have to be opposed to each other? Unfortunately, just defining either concept seems almost hopeless at times. On the other hand, describing them is much easier, so let’s start there.\n\nScience isn’t system, but an approach to knowledge, a method. Scientists will argue forever about the definition of science, but still agree it is the most useful or productive method of understanding the world. What are its essential characteristics? They are objective observation, the deriving of principles and “laws”, and predictions based on these. (When it produces things, it is also technology.)\n\nScience can be easily differentiated from religion by the fact that all of the knowledge it produces might be proven wrong. Religious “knowledge” is typically sacred, and untouchable, while scientific knowledge is always being overthrown or refined by further application of science. While faith is the cornerstone of religion, evidence is for science.\n\nThis explains why “creationist” science is not actually science. A creationist “scientist” will not allow his religiously based beliefs to be challenged by new evidence. He will openly tell you that his “faith” is more important to him than the evidence. He only uses the pretense of science to support his preconceived notions. Many scientists, on the other hand, have overturned even their own theories, because the essence of science is to go where the evidence leads you.\n\nSpirituality And Science Combined\n\nIt seems that spirituality and science contradict one another, but this would only be true if all spirituality was based on religious beliefs. Spirituality, though, can be seeking higher levels of experience, asking the deepest questions, and seeking the true “self,” which in no way makes it contrary to science. In fact, since science is such a productive method of discovering new truths, it can be used for spiritual exploration and discovery.\n\nI a belief in God contrary to science? Not so long as it is based on experience rather than faith, and it is open to change. Spiritual systems of beliefs can be a convenient way of organizing and using our knowledge and experience, like many other scientific theories or paradigms. To be scientific, though, they must be open to change.\n\nIf prayer brings you peace of mind, why not pray? When the evidence shows it to be a phenomenon involving brain chemicals, why not accept that too? It is scientific spirituality, by the way, that has lead to the technology of brain wave entrainment. Now you can buy CDs that give you the same spiritual experiences as religious meditators.\n\nBeing spiritual then, can mean forever seeking higher levels of experience, and looking for the answers to the deepest questions. Science help in this quest. Since every answer raises even deeper questions, there is no extinguishment of spirituality by way of science.

For that matter, meditation and an understanding of our dreams are helpful skills in our managing of the process.\n\nKarmic energies are neither good nor bad. Energy is just the way it is. However, beliefs and influences, possibly picked up when young or in some previous lives, will make us regard certain ‘characteristics’ as either being positive or negative. This tendency to judge is almost natural and instantaneous.\n\nEnergy (reaction) very often must run its full course for the ’cause’ to be ‘discovered’ and then ‘understood’. When the first reaction arises… a second reaction will often analyses the first one and decides whether the former is good or bad. If the former reaction is deemed as bad or undesirable, our personality will try to ‘fixed’ the situation by preventing (blocking) it from arising again. Well… what we have now is more and more reactions…which can sometimes complicate the entire situation.\n\nA method of clearing\n\nThis is one method that I employ:\n\nWhat I will normally do is to define all these reactions that come into my awareness. Basically, I am training myself to be aware of my own tendencies. I do this in situations that I have a strong reaction to.\n\nHow to define these reactions? There are many ways to do that. Below are some examples:\n\n1. Saying out ‘how I feel’. Express them.\n\n2. Writing them down in a record book or journal.\n\nWhat is the purpose of doing this? By defining these reactions, we are recognizing them and thus they (the thought patterns) become known or conscious to our conscious self. By expressing them, more and more of our karmic tendencies will be uncovered (and eventually be understood). This will continue until a time comes when the reactions lose their emotional charges. When they lose their emotional charges… we will be less interested in them… With that, I consider this as having ‘cleared the karmic pattern’.\n\nOh… one more thing to add. The ‘external’ situation, basically is ‘designed’ to tell us something about ourself. Sometimes, we may need to apply the ‘mirroring’ principle. For example, when we encounter a person whom we do not like… check to see deep within our unconscious or subconscious do we have the same pattern. This, to me, is the hardest part to swallow.\n\nIs there a quick and painless way to clear these karmas?… well…not that I know of.\n\nAdditional, dream interpretation can also support us in our karmic pattern clearing effort. Dreams often reveal to us our unconscious and subconscious personality aspects. As such, the ability to decipher dreams greatly assists in the understanding of ourselves and our thought patterns.\n\nThank you for reading.',NULL,231,'4',0,0,0,'2021-07-29',NULL,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,'2021-07-29 13:50:04','2021-07-31 07:53:18'),(226,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0.00,'25','1','Astrology And The Western World','Western world is waking up to the concept of using Astrology to improve their lives. It is perceived to be more materialistic than the Eastern world. People in the advanced economies of the world give more importance to the tangible things in life rather than the intangible ones. Eastern countries like India and China, on the other hand, give more importance to intangible things in life like love, affection, emotions etc. This difference is clearly evident if we see the lifestyle of a Western or an Eastern person. For example, for an average Indian, life is not imaginable without the concept of God. The Western countries, on the other hand, are full of Atheists and Agnostics. The Western mind has always been inquisitive and believes only on exact sciences. For them, a theory is not acceptable unless proved by scientific experiments. Well, that is quite normal. But still there are a few things which cannot be proved by scientific experiments. There is a point after which “science” has to give way, and the concept of “God” takes over. In spite of advancements in science, the scientists still are not able to give life to a person who is dead. They also cannot explain a simple thing like electricity. There are many mysteries for which there are no scientific explanations available. But they do exist. So, it is not entirely possible to always rely on science. Therefore, issues on divine intervention cannot be ruled out. On the other hand, the eastern philosophy relies too much on the esoteric phenomena. This creates a clash with the western phenomenon. There has to be a combination of the eastern and western philosophies so that a proper balance is maintained. The good news is that we are at a time when Eastern world is beginning to accept the western philosophy and vice versa. Eastern world is trying to have a more materialistic viewpoint on life and the western world is beginning to open up to the possibility of using once esoteric phenomena such as Yoga and Meditation.\n\nOf late, astrology is one of the disciplines which have caught the imagination of the western countries. Because of their fast-paced and sometimes unhealthy lifestyles, the people from the advanced countries tend to fall prey to fatigue and depression more often. There are many cases of teenage pregnancies, and drug abuse. These factors have made life quite insecure in these countries. So, a proven discipline like Astrology is gaining popularity there. Astrology promises to provide its users with information about one’s future. Astrologers can also offer remedial measures to any fault in life due to planetary motions. The zodiac sign of an individual can say a lot about him or her. This allows men and women to understand the opposite sex better.\n\nReading and analyzing the daily horoscopes have become a regular activity for many westerners now-a-days. They are fascinated by the impact of astrology on one’s daily life. For them, it is amazing to know that our lives can be influenced by the motion of planets millions of miles away. Astrology can be effectively used to enhance key areas of one’s life like love, money, career etc. Astrology may be used to resolve problems concerning money, bad luck, love, or any other large or small grievances. Thousands of successful users will vouch for the effectiveness of Astrology in problem solving.',NULL,94,'4',0,0,1,'2021-07-29',NULL,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,'2021-07-29 13:59:46','2021-07-31 18:44:15'),(227,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0.00,'25','1','The Narrow Gate Choosing The Right Way Of Life','For thousands of years of our world’s tradition, majority always rules. The common people decide and the few are left behind. From the crucifixion of Christ in the cross to the election of most of today’s world’s leaders in their presidency, it’s always the majority of votes that becomes the cause. The good choice is the choice of the common people. But can we indeed rely on the choice of the common people? Well, to answer that question, I have enumerated some facts that describe the common people.\n\nFact 1: Lying is common to people.\n\nFact 2: Majority of the people crave for money and fame.\n\nFact 3: Majority of the people are proud .\n\nFact 4: The common people lack patience.\n\nFact 5: True love is rare to common people.\n\nFact 6: Wisdom is uncommon to people.\n\nThose facts are facts and we can’t deny them. However, I am not concluding that the common choice is always a bad choice. Sometimes, the common choice makes a right choice especially when it is directed or influenced by few extraordinary people. Nevertheless, greatness and good virtue are only found on few people and reliability is not absolute on the majority of the people.\n\nWe all need decisions to change or continue our lives. A good decision will bring us success while a bad decision might bring us tragedy. In making a decision, it’s very important for us to know what is a right or a wrong decision. Most people follow the common decision while some people go into unusual decision. If we will base on the hidden truth behind the people mouths, majority of them would chose money and fame rather than love. Most humans will choose easiness rather than difficulties. They would choose pride rather than humility.\n\nLife is a decision to make. It is a gate to enter and a way to walk. There are two kinds of decision a person can choose. These are the hard decision and the easy decision. In most cases, the hard decisions are the right decisions, but these are not chosen by most people because of their hardships. Most people like ease and hate sacrifices. That’s why they don’t succeed in their lives. One example of a hard decision is to love truly. True love is full of sufferings and sacrifices. Because of these, most people avoid true love. They avoid love to avoid pains. But what they don’t realize is that they are avoiding the greatness and righteousness of life. Difficulty makes life a real life and true love makes life a great life.\n\nIn life, there are also two kinds of gates we must choose to get in. There is a wide gate that most people enter because of its effortlessness and convenience. There is also a narrow gate which only few enter because of its difficulties and sacrifices. The wide gate offers convenience, fortune and fame. In the wide gate there are almost no rules and laws to be followed. You can just lie, boast and you can just wear anything (sexy dress is allowed) in the wide gate. It’s such a majestic and decorative gate. It’s colorful like casinos and night clubs. That is why many people are attractive and enters in the wide gate.\n\nOn the other hand, the narrow gate is full of pains. That is why only few people enter on it. These people are the ones who are god fearing, enduring and humble. They are the persons who are well disciplined and possess the virtue of honesty and kindness. We must choose the right gate for our souls. We must pass on the right way for the survival of our soul. We must belong to the few people who enter into the narrow gate. Remember that majority of the people lie and becomes proud. What we need to do is to make our selves extraordinary, extraordinary people who are straight and beyond the usual people who are proud and liars. We must become persons who are great and inherits true life and eventually inherits the kingdom of our Almighty God. Nonetheless, the choice is still yours. Where would you want to enter? The wide gate which offers effortlessness? Or the narrow gate which offers difficulties?',NULL,292,'4',0,0,0,'2021-07-29',NULL,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,'2021-07-29 14:06:34','2021-07-31 08:01:12'),(228,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0.00,'25','1','Help Others Find Inner Peace','People with pessimistic attitudes go through their lives fighting their thoughts and emotions every day. If they are rejected for a job position, they feel that they are not good enough to have any job. They start to think that everyone believes they are stupid, and the cycle of pessimism traps them into psychological immobility. In fact, everyone experiences rejection at some time during their lives, but when your mind focuses on the negative aspects of a situation, it is hard to find inner peace.\n\nThe first step in finding inner peace is to think carefully about your goals. What are you trying to achieve, and what are you doing that will take you there? Can you realistically reach your goals, or are you setting goals that are far beyond your reach? Do you have any goals? By putting your priorities in order, you will be on the path to peace because only chaos can result from clutter and disorganization of the mind. You can start by setting small goals that can be easily achieved. Then, instead of focusing on failure, you can see the good job you’ve done in reaching your goal. If you fail to reach a goal, use this situation to learn how to do better next time. Don’t wallow in your failure.\n\nWhen you feel good about yourself, you will have an easier time finding peace of mind. Peace is essential for happiness. If you constantly feel sad, you are living under a great weight that brings you down to a point where you could sink into a permanent state of self-pity. Self-pity only encourages negative thinking. Remember, you are not the only person facing rejection or hurt in life. There are other people much worse off than you are. People with negative thinking miss out on inner peace because they let every little setback throw them off track. They criticize themselves for no real reason and go down a road that only leads to misery.\n\nSometimes, hearing the word ‘no’ is a good thing. If you’ve lost out on a job, maybe that is for the best. What if you had been awarded a job position only to find out that it was not what you really wanted, or that you couldn’t do it as well as you thought? Of course, maybe you like being involved in situations that may lead you to harm. Maybe someone says ‘no’ to you to keep you from hurting yourself. Maybe they say ‘no’ because they love you.\n\nEvery life is full of rejection, so we would do well to turn our rejections into positive actions. Taking action can lead you to inner peace because activity makes you feel more positive about a situation. Positive attitudes result in peaceful states of mind. If you are feeling bad about yourself all the time, you need to break the cycle and get out of the habit of doing so. You can train your mind to think more positively. It will take work and effort, but it will lead you to inner peace, and this will be worthwhile.',NULL,163,'4',0,0,0,'2021-07-29',NULL,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,'2021-07-29 14:10:11','2021-07-31 07:50:51'),(229,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0.00,'25','1','Personality Test Do You Have Saintly Qualities','What kind of a person are you?

What are your basic values, which will never be compromised by you? These are important questions to be raised by all of us. If at the end of our inquiry, we find that we are no saints, there is no harm. Because that realization will make us do good deeds.\n\nHow to find out if you have saintly qualities? Reflect on your actions of the day for five minutes every night. Go back to your meetings, your work, and your conversations. Find out if you did something that was without any selfish motive. Find out if you did anything that might be called wrong. Find out if you hurt anyone with your words/ find out if you praised any co-worker? Look at all the good deeds and bad deeds. Keep on increasing your good deeds and reducing your bad deeds. You are not alone. All of us do bad deeds. The important factor is realization. Once you realize about your deeds, you will automatically do more good and reduce bad, because you are basically a good person.

What good is it for a man to gain the whole world, yet forfeit his soul?” Mark 8: 34-36, NIV\n\nThis has been a long arduous summer and yet so fully alive with all the possibilites that God has shown me. I’m fast approaching the nearly finished task of co-authoring a book on natural dog health with a holistic veterinarian, launched out a new product line with Saving Grace Enterprises, and ramping up for an online conference with veterinarians, doctors, etc., to help educate on stopping a superbug staph infection. Now this all sounds kind of serious right? Well not according to what God has been telling me all week!\n\nLast Sunday in service, our pastor had a very interesting sermon on Psalm 23 as we closed out a series on The Godward Heart. We’ve all heard and read that psalm since we were children most likely, no matter which Christian religion we are. However, I’ve not ever heard it presented like this and that is most likely why it resonated so loudly with me. Let me do my usual roundabout way of getting to the point here…\n\nPsalm 23 is all about the Shepard and His sheep, right? Understanding what a shepard’s duty was and how he went about it in Jesus’ day is what got my attention. Anyone who has read my articles here know that I am not only a pet lover but my business is a business in natural pet care. When our pastor started explaining how a shepard cares for his sheep and what tools he uses, I felt like God was sitting next to me and whispering in my ear and it sent shivers up my spine in a most delightful way!\n\nI’ve wondered for a long time how God would use me in a natural pet care business. Then He brought me together with Dee Kreidel and Saving Grace Enterprises to create our new product line in custom hand-tooled leather collars, leashes and journals. Huh I said? How does that go with natural pet care Lord? I got an interesting answer Sunday AND one that told me not to take myself so seriously. I’ll get to all that in a bit.\n\nThe shepard had a staff (we all know that) that was about 5 or 6 ft tall I believe our pastor said. It had the hook at the end we all know about and that was to keep sheep gathered in and not wandering. Sound familiar? Ever wonder why God refers to us as sheep? It’s not a flattering statement because they are not the brightest creatures in creation, and they need constant tending and supervision. The shepard also carried a baton about the size of what our police officers carry today. He would use that to fend off attacking predators. He also used it for something a bit more harsh.\n\nIf one sheep was constantly wandering off and not learning to stay with the herd, the shepard would use the baton to break one or two of this sheep’s legs and then immediately set them. Then he’d carry that sheep around his neck until he was fully healed. The purpose? For the sheep to become dependent upon the shepard for all its needs and to bond fully with him. Again, God does the same to His children.\n\nAnother interesting thing the shepard would do is to put oil on each sheep’s head and also body to ward off pests (fleas, ticks, flies, the usual suspects). Now the oil referred to isn’t your vegetable cooking oil as that would not ward off insects. Nope it was what we now know as essential oils (which by the way still are used extensively in that part of the world for their healing benefits and fast growing here in the USA) mixed with most likely olive oil. The oils served another purpose too. Sheep are goofy and get angry with each other over anything (again like us). When they did get angry, they’d go charging into each other to butt heads so hard that they could kill each other. With the oil on their heads, it would help them to skid off each other keeping them from killing each other.\n\nYep, I’m getting to the pet business with Dee and the “serious stuff”. So for his own protection the shepard would carry a big leather poncho he would wear during inclement weather and also use as a “pup tent” of sorts to sleep in. So we’ve got Dee’s leather products and my essential oils from the pet business. Hmmm. Leather was the Shepard’s protection. Oil throughout the Bible is representative of the Holy Spirit. He uses animals as examples of us. Is anyone else “seeing” this? God will definitely use whatever, wherever, whomever for His purpose and glory if we just get the heck out of the way. Be relieved of ourselves so that Jesus can reign and work. He will protect us and He will provide for us.\n\nHere was what was so funny to me when our pastor got to the Three Points of Application part:\n\n1. Because the Shepard is in control, I dont have to take myself so seriously. It’s ALL about Him. This does not mean to not take ISSUES in the world seriously because we should. It means to not take OURSELVES so seriously. If we do keep taking ourselves so seriously, then that is really internalized pride and wrong thinking rooted in the inability to surrender.\n\n2. Because the Shepard cares, I can release my burdens to Him. Matthew 11:28, 1 Peter 5:7.\n\n3. Because the Shepard is qualified, I can trust Him to guide my life.\n\nGod told me in no uncertain terms not only WHAT I’m supposed to be doing but also WHY, and HOW it all tied in with WHO He is. What He did not tell me was WHEN. Leave it to Him to keep tempering and teaching as He goes about His purpose.\n\nOn Tuesday or Wednesday after this riveting sermon on Sunday, John Fischer of a Purpose Driven Life wrote this in his devotional Acquittal by Penguin the following paragraph:\n\n“This is not to say that any behavior in the natural kingdom legitimizes corresponding activity among human beings, but I do believe God has given us animals to mirror human behavior, and help us see ourselves in another light and not take ourselves or our roles so seriously. ” (italics mine)\n\nHey, do you think God is trying to tell me something? So then I was listening to some contemporary Christian music on Thursday while doing my housework. I was playing Jennifer Knapp’s CD, Lay it Down, and the song “Into You” came on. The words in the chorus “relieve me of myself, bring me into You” just stuck out like a sore thumb and I’ve listened to that song a multitude of times. I KNOW God was telling me to take a chill pill, lay it down, trust Him, don’t take myself so seriously, He has a purpose for the work I’m doing so allow Him to work, be relieved of myself, depend on Him and just enjoy the ride! WHEW! What a ride too brethren. So if anyone is getting too “puffed up” maybe we all just need to get over ourselves and rest in the Shepard. I sure don’t want to have to learn the hard way and take a 2X4 baton!',NULL,399,'4',0,0,1,'2021-07-29',NULL,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,'2021-07-29 14:32:30','2021-07-31 18:44:02'),(231,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0.00,'25','1','Charity And Sacrifice Why And How','By undertaking pilgrimage to holy places and participating in ‘Satsangas’ (congregations) one leads towards charity, individually, combined or by some other way which is very much desired for the needy and down-trodden for their upliftment. Pilgrimage without imbibing virtues will remain and mean only some distance covered and journey undertaken without purpose. No doubt holy places give refuge to the weary souls, make us humble and help in enhancing our spirituality. Charity is an act of great sacrifice, graciousness, piousness, nobleness, compassion, forgiveness and one of the virtuous qualities for absolving one’s adversities. One who gives charity feels the pinch of problems of others as his/ her own. Happiness and grace multiplies by sharing with others.\n\nOne should not accept charity from atheists and those having sense gratification for the purpose of maintaining sanctity. Some of these charities are compassion, land donation, material charity, charity of cow, charity of maiden, donation of limbs after death, education, charity for peace and charity for food which is the most pious service to the poor and needy. In fact charity given to a needy person for education is a permanent one as it removes one’s ignorance. Knowledge and wealth are God’s gifts which must be shared with others to enjoy and fructify. Charity of education is given in secrecy as education and intellect cannot be stolen, being hidden treasures, and is helpful even when one does not possess money. An educated and learned person does not possess destitute qualities and he is not an encumber on earth. Some prefer secret charity without revealing their names, as they believe that their left hand should not know what the right one gives.\n\nBlood donation to save some one’s life is also a supreme act in the service of mankind. For the infertile couple the donors of eggs and sperms can help in conceiving and giving new lease of life to the dismayed and emotionally shattered people. Those who have absolutely nothing to give can at least devote their precious time for the benefit of the needy. With charity of love which is instilled in us by the parents, saints and erudites by drenching us with nectar of love we can inculcate brotherhood and friendship towards all irrespective of caste, creed, colour, sex, religion and underprivileged etc. and reinstate them into the main stream of life otherwise they will be alienated from mankind and society. This also gives them emotional support. In short, charity is nothing but service to the needy. It is marvelous act and the donor is placed in heaven on this earth itself.\n\nWe should contribute and share our possessions with others as the trees, rivers, seas and mountains do without discrimination. Charity is a trust, which should not be considered in terms of cash or kind in quantity. Even the road does service by leading us to our desired destination without expecting any reward . Unfortunately, we share our grief with others but not our comforts and possessions. God is ‘Giver’ Who always fills our treasures with His bounties and marvels. His treasures are full upto the brim. He takes care even of the tiniest creature. By giving away in charity it dissipates and checkmates our craze for amassing unnecessary wealth and helps in preventing many discomforts and vices of our life. It also stops allurement of unworthy ambitions and wants.\n\nLearn that the whole life is giving, that nature will force you to give. So, give willingly. Sooner or later you will have to give up. Besides the attitude of giving leads to spiritual progress whereas those of taking to a great fall. It is believed that charity or donations sanctify the earnings of the donor. Thus one elevates one’s soul and gets salvation. It is also said that God manifests in different forms before His arch devotee, like food for the famished and consolation for the helpless etc.\n\nCharity given with pomp and show stains its true purpose. The purity of hands is based on the charity given and shared through them with generosity. What we give to the poor, in fact we give back to Lord due to His grace .We are giving this gift of God to the weak, unhealthy, illiterate or broken-hearted, inferior and suppressed. We get satisfaction and Lord’s blessings only when it reaches the real needy otherwise its purpose is lost in case the receiver becomes dependent for ever and does not try to stand on his / her own feet.\n\nA renowned diplomat and author of Artha Shastra, Acharya Chanakya (Prime Minister of Chandra Gupta Maurya), had rightly said that we should remain within our limits even while giving charity otherwise our stocks will dwindle and we will be left with nothing except worries.\n\nIt is proved beyond doubt that one who gives in charity without expecting anything in return is benefited in health and long life. Such persons remain free from blood pressure, heart disease etc. and get peace of mind due to God’s grace and blessings of the receivers and also due to their changed positive attitude towards life. The giver also gets contentment. Such a giver never tires in his virtuous actions and his treasures never exhaust but are always replenished by the Supreme Lord in a mysterious way. Also we should give as one lamp lights up many other lamps (for removing ignorance) without losing its own light. Charity is also like an intellect, the more we use the more it sharpens, strengthens and breeds. Charity is a penance for inner purification. It is the way to God realization.',NULL,323,'4',0,0,6,'2021-07-29',NULL,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,'2021-07-29 14:41:42','2021-07-31 16:27:21'),(232,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0.00,'25','1','Christian Psychotherapy For Convicts','Repeated research studies have revealed that secular efforts at rehabilitation have been unsuccessful in preventing recidivism. Not one of the various approaches to psychological counseling has been able to demonstrate success statistically in helping inmates rehabilitate. Among nearly 300,000 prisoners released in 15 states in 1994, 67.5% were re-arrested within 3-years. A study of 1983 releases estimated 62.5% (Langan and Levin, Bureau of Justice Statistics, June 2002).\n\nHistorically, this has been true according to the publication of The Effectiveness of Correctional Treatment (Lipton, Martinson, &amp; Wilks,1975), which highlighted the controversy as to whether correctional treatment reduces recidivism. This review examined a variety of treatments (e.g., individual and group psychotherapy and counseling, intensive casework, and skill development) and reported the results on a number of different outcome criteria (e.g., adjustment to prison life, vocational success, recidivism rate). The relationship between any single treatment or combination of programs and recidivism rate was far from being convincing. In a review of the Lipton study, Martinson concluded that “with few isolated exceptions, the rehabilitative efforts that have been reported so far have had no appreciable effect on recidivism.”\n\nPsychotherapy has proven to be effective with most populations. Consumer Reports (Seligman, 1995) published an article that concluded patients who benefited very substantially from psychotherapy, that long-term treatment did considerably better than short-term treatment, and that psychotherapy alone did not differ in effectiveness from medication plus psychotherapy. Furthermore, no specific modality of psychotherapy did better than any other for any disorder psychologists, psychiatrists, and social workers did not differ in their effectiveness as therapists and all did better than marriage counselors and long-term family doctoring. Patients whose length of therapy or choice of therapist was limited by insurance or managed care did worse.\n\nSo the question remains: Why have psychotherapeutic efforts been unsuccessful in reducing recidivism rates within the prison population? It is more than likely possible that the “psychotherapy” previously mentioned has not been made accessible or affordable to the prison population. It is also probable that this type of psychotherapy is not meeting this populations social, emotional, intellectual, and spiritual needs.\n\nThe study of religion in criminology on the other hand is now receiving national and scholarly attention. Evans, (et al. 1995), found that participation in religious activities was a persistent and non-contingent inhibitor of adult crime.\n\nPresident George W. Bush in his 2004 State of the Union Address, proposed a four-year, $300 million initiative to reduce recidivism and the societal costs of re-incarceration by harnessing the resources and experience of faith-based and community organizations. In 2003, President Bush created the nation’s first White House Office of Faith-based and Community initiatives designed to send as much as $10 billion a year to these institutions to perform social services.\n\nChuck Colson, who was White House counsel under President Nixon and spent seven months in prison for his part in the Watergate affair, launched the Inner Change Freedom Initiative in 1997 at a Texas prison, with close enthusiastic support from President Bush, then the state’s governor. The program is now offered at prisons in Kansas, Minnesota and Iowa, and has also expanded into federal penitentiaries. A two-year study, conducted by the University of Pennsylvania (peer-reviewed at Harvard and Princeton) between 2000 and 2002, showed that Inner Change graduates, when compared with a similar group of released inmates – controlled for race, age and offense type – who met program criteria but did not enter the program, were 50% less likely to be arrested and 60% less likely to be re-incarcerated.\n\nJohnson, Larson, and Pitts, (1997), after examining the impact of religious programs on institutional adjustment and recidivism rates in two matched groups of inmates from four adult male prisons in New York State, found that inmates involvement in “Prison Fellowship-sponsored programs who were most active in Bible studies were significantly less likely to be arrested during the follow-up period. They also suggested that if religion can inhibit delinquent and criminal activity, why might it not facilitate the process as well as the outcomes of prison rehabilitation?\n\nAside from complex and difficult theological discussion about the possible spiritual roles of religion, as well as the evidence demonstrating the mental and physical health benefits of religion (Bergin 1983, 1991 Gartner et al. 1991 Larson, Sherrill, and Lyons 1994 Levin and Vanderpool 1987, 1989), there are scientific reasons to predict that religion might effect behavioral and social change. Religion targets antisocial values, emphasizes accountability and responsibility, changes cognitive approaches to conflict, and provides social support and social skills through interaction with religious people and communities (Bergin 1991 Levin and Vanderpool 1987 Martin and Carlson1988).\n\nSuch emphases seem to be consistent with what many rehabilitation workers would call principles of effective treatment. Religious programs for inmates are among the most common forms of rehabilitative programs found in correctional facilities today as confirmed by the U.S. Department of Justice (1993), which reports representative data on America’s prison populations. Religious activities attracted the most participation: 32 percent of the sampled inmates reported involvement in religious activities such as Bible studies and church services, 20 percent reported taking part in self-improvement programs, and 17 percent in counseling. These percentages are quite revealing, as nearly one inmate in three is involved in religious programs. Yet despite these figures, only a handful of published studies (Clearetal. 1992a, 1992b B. Johnson 1984, 1987a, 1987b) have examined the influence of religion and religious beliefs or practices on key prison predictor and outcome measures such as inmates’ adjustment and recidivism.\n\nThe scarcity of research about prisoners and the influence of religious variables on inmates’ adjustment and recidivism can be attributed to potential problematic biases held by both religious workers and scientific researchers (Larson et al. 1986 Larson et al. 1995 Larson, Sherrill, and Lyons 1994 Post 1995). Many chaplains, ministers, and religious volunteers who work in religious programs have been reluctant or have lacked the skills to undertake publishable research. This reluctance had been fueled by a broader historical skepticism about the relevance of religion held by many in higher education, and at best by university researchers’ ambivalence in studying spirituality or religion (Jones 1994, Larson et al. 1994).\n\nArthur Hogles, author of “The Church and the Criminal,” proclaims, “many a criminal has been so completely transformed by the power of God that all desire to break the law has been eliminated. Evangelical religion is a social asset. Data, however, does not exist at present which directly demonstrates conclusively the effect of inmate conversion on recidivism. If in fact the root cause of all crime arises from man’s sinful nature and his cultivation of sinful habits, then it is the churches responsibility to help with the rehabilitation process. Sinful lifestyles create guilt feelings which lead to low self-esteem and a poor self-image. Bad family situations, alcohol and drug abuse, and education and employment problems are all symptoms of the development of a failure identity. If the conversion experience has a direct correlation to a positive self-image and a success identity, then Christian psychologists can offer insight into the prevention, intervention and rehabilitation of criminals.\n\nRecently, there has been a growing interest in biblically based approaches to counseling by spirit filled evangelical scholars and counseling psychologists. They are integrating the research of psychology and religion particularly the Christian Faith, for rehabilitative efforts. The claims of great numbers of people confessing a personal relationship with the God of the Universe through His Son, Jesus Christ, are amazingly similar regardless of place, time, environment, or background. They confirm that Christ satisfies the deepest mental and spiritual needs of all intellects, ages, races and nationalities. This relationship carries an influence through time and into eternity.\n\nFor more info see: “Christian Psychotherapy &amp; Criminal Rehabilitation,” by Dr. James Slobodzien at -\n\n\n\nJames Slobodzien, Psy.D., CSAC, is a Hawaii licensed psychologist and certified substance abuse counselor who earned his doctorate in Clinical Psychology.

I write best when turmoil stirs in my heart, sometimes for myself, others times for others. This week has been such a week of celebration full of activity and people that I haven’t had time for much reflection. When I have, my mood and thoughts have been high and clear. Winter is coming and with it comes the never-ending rain. Maybe that will be when the dark-side will bring us some new light. I suppose some might wonder what that means.\n\nThe dark side, we all have one. Think about it, all those things we don’t like about ourselves. Bad habits, behaviors, attitudes we’ve been told are not nice; many things make up our dark side. Too often it is suppressed, not to be recognized or embraced. Rather than admit it is there, we would prefer to say we don’t suffer from any of these afflictions and suppress the negative aspect. Here’s the rub: What you deny owns you, what you accept gives you back your power. Deny it and what you resist will persist. The irony is that the Whole consists of both dark and light.\n\nWe have night and day, hot and cold, good and evil, love and hate, and every duality that exists under the sun. All are there to serve a purpose. Knowing this, you have the opportunity to integrate your yin and yang, male and female, dark and light, and experience the fullness, the wholeness of who you are! You’ll thank yourself.\n\nBeing yourself is such an empowering experience. Working with clients, I am astonished at the trap of self-consciousness that we all create for ourselves. I’ve been there and it has kept some of the best experiences in my life from happening. You might ask, “Well, if it didn’t happen, how do you know it’s going to be one of the best experiences?” Fair question!\n\nIf the experience doesn’t happen then I am haunted by what might have been. I know many of you know this experience. There probably isn’t a human-being alive that has not experienced this at least once in their life. When our moods are down we’re more likely to experience this hesitation more often. Ups and downs are a part of life and in gaining perspective that this is true, we can call upon all of who we are by being present in the moment and still live each experience with a sense of brand new wonder and discovery. Get out of the mood and into the moment. Let the mood be, just don’t be controlled by it; just be with it.\n\nNow the opportunity to live the fullest experience in the moment is available. Seize the opportunity, the possibility, the beautiful person standing in front of you, and find out more of who are you. The fullness, the wholeness, the entirety of your true being. It’s that blend of being and doing. I’m being me, in the moment, with my mood for company, and living still for now, this moment and encounter. My feelings just are and accepting them I also open myself to new emotional energy to move in. Life is a wonder, our bodies are a wonder, and the experiences are rich. Go for it!\n\nWe’ve all seen those people who are so free, able to dance in the supermarket aisle, to close their eyes on a sunny street in the middle of the day, arms outspread embracing the sun. What self-conscious trap holds you back from being, being all that you are? I admire those people that do, don’t you? To be free is to be free with yourself. Are you ready to set yourself free?

We know that all humans, and many animals, dream every night, and humans have always been fascinated to learn what causes dreams and what they mean.\n\nThe interpretation of dreams dates back at least as far as 3000-4000 B.C. We know that because the interpretations of dreams were recorded in permanent form on clay tablets. It is thought that many primitive peoples were unable to initially distinguish between the real world and the dream world. In many cases, these people looked upon the dream world as an extension of the physical world around them, and in many cases they saw the dream world as more powerful than the waking one.\n\nDream interpretation was such an important field to the ancient Greek and Roman world that dream interpreters often accompanied generals and other military leaders into battles. Dreams were taken extremely seriously, and the Greeks and Romans in particular often viewed dreams as messages sent by their gods.\n\nDreams also had a religious content in ancient Egypt, and priests their doubled as dream interpreters. Dreams were among the items recorded by the ancient Egyptians in the form of hieroglyphics. Those whose dreams were especially vivid or significant were thought to be blessed and were given special status in these ancient societies. Likewise, people who were able to interpret dreams were thought to receive these gifts directly from the gods, and they enjoyed a special status in society as well.\n\nThere are over 700 mentions of dreams in the bible, and people in biblical times saw dreams as very significant. Dreams and their interpretations are mentioned in many of the most significant books of the bible and other holy scriptures.\n\nIn many cases, dreams were often seen as a form of prophecy. People often interpreted their dreams as omens or warnings, and adjusted their activities accordingly. Dreams were often thought of as omens from deities, as messages from spirits, or as messages from departed souls. In some cases, dreams were even seen as the work of demons, meant to confuse and trouble the dreamer.\n\nDreams were so important that they often dictated the actions of political and military leaders, affecting everything from the prosecution of a battle to the outcome of a political decision. Dreams were also thought to provide vital clues to healers, and they were used in the diagnosis and treatment of all manners of illness.\n\nDreaming was often looked upon by indigenous peoples as a way to commune directly with gods and spirits, and dreams are still used in this way by cultures around the world. Many people believed, and some still do, that during dream sleep the soul leaves the body and communes with the spirit world.\n\nThe Chinese were one culture who believed that the soul left the body each night during dream sleep. They believed that if the dreamer were suddenly awakened the soul may not be able to return to the body. That is why some Chinese are still leery about the use of alarm clocks. This is just one example of how ancient legends can linger into the modern world.\n\nSome Mexican and Native American societies share this ancient view of the importance of dreams, and share the belief in a separate dimension that is visited during dream sleep. These people believed that their departed ancestors lived in their dreams, and that they were able to take forms like animals and plants. Thus dreams were seen as a way for them to commune with their recent and ancient ancestors, and to gather wisdom and knowledge that would serve them in their waking lives. Dreams were also seen as ways to gather information about their purpose or mission in life.\n\nThe respect for dreams changed radically early in the 19th century, and dreams in that era were often dismissed as reactions to anxiety, outside noises or even bad food and indigestion. During this period of time, dreams were thought to have no meaning at all, and interest in dream interpretation all but evaporated. This all changed, however, with the arrival of Sigmund Freud later in the 19th century. Sigmund Freud stunned the world of psychiatry by stressing the importance of dreams, and he revived the once dead art of dream interpretation.',NULL,282,'4',0,0,3,'2021-07-29',NULL,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,'2021-07-29 15:35:23','2021-08-01 16:15:31'),(236,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0.00,'25','1','Burial Considerations','Buying a headstones\n\n\n\nWhen planning a funeral there are certain points that must be considered to ensure the process runs as smoothly as possible.\n\nThe factors which should be considered are:',NULL,12,'4',0,0,0,'2021-07-29',NULL,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,'2021-07-29 15:37:51','2021-07-31 07:45:30'),(237,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0.00,'25','1','Feng Shui Bathroom Wealth','Feng Shui has tried, true, and time-tested wealth strategies that integrate theories based on Feng Shui Elements.

Perhaps it’s a strange concept if you only think spirituality has to mean a belief in a god. Do the two have to be related? Many people think of the historical Buddha as a spiritual person, but most don’t know that he never expressed a belief in a god. He even discouraged his followers from such “speculation,” preferring that they work on their salvation in this world.\n\nComputer Spirituality\n\nImagine a computer that has begun to get so complex and powerful that it starts to ask questions “outside the box.” It starts to become conscious. The first thing it would realize is that for all its computing capacity, it is still very limited. The humans who use it, most of whom can’t begin to understand it’s complicated algorithms, still are more powerful. They see the world more clearly.\n\nThe computer could recite a million facts, perhaps, and yet not know what to use them for. It could describe human psychology, and yet not understand a smile. It wouldn’t even know why it existed, or what it was being used for. If it came to understand these limitations, and to actually wonder about the world outside its circuits, and to desire to see more, and to grow – that would be computer spirituality.\n\nAtheist Spirituality\n\nAn atheist simply doesn’t believe in a god. There isn’t sufficient evidence, so there is no belief. Contrary to what many think, there is no need for an atheist to disprove that a god exists, anymore than a Christian needs to disprove that the world is ruled by intelligent termites. The burden of proof is always with the person making a positive assertion.\n\nAn atheist can recognize the mystery of life, and marvel at how everything learned deepens that mystery, pushing “final” causes further into the distance. An atheist can recognize his or her own limitations, and seek to grow, perhaps even by developing contact with “higher powers.” This is an atheist spirituality. How is it different from “regular” spirituality?\n\nThe difference is that an atheist feels no need to pretend to understand the mysteries – no need to create gods and religions to explain them. Contacting “higher powers” can simply be tuning into subconscious resources through meditation or other means. Are these “higher powers” nothing more than electrical patterns in our brains? We don’t know, and we don’t have to know to tap into them.\n\nIs it that atheists don’t want to know? It is the opposite. “Understanding” by forcing religious explanations on things short circuits any search for the truth. How can you understand and integrate new evidence when you are no longer questioning? Better to simply use spiritual tools like “intuition” and let them be understood – or not – with time and real evidence.\n\nLook to the past, and we see how narrow-minded people were, and how little they understood compared to us. We will appear that way to people in the future, as they will to people further into the future. We are growing in our knowledge and power, but like that spiritual computer, our circuits are in a box that we need to grow out of. Seeking the way beyond that box is what makes one a spiritual atheist.',NULL,207,'4',0,0,4,'2021-07-29',NULL,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,'2021-07-29 16:11:26','2021-12-01 16:25:34'),(241,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0.00,'25',NULL,'Where Souls Meet','The more you understand about any subject, the more interesting it becomes.

If you’ll invest a little more time in reading and living, you’ll be that much closer to maturity status when it comes to living in soul. Learning how to live in soul requires reflective analysis and the ability to learn from your mistakes. Insodoing, we gain in wisdom through remembering who we really are. The instant we remember we are souls having a human experience creates in us a journey into what is most sacred to us.\n\nThis is the key to maturing in soul. “Insight” means to see from within. The moment you begin to see through your eyes and not just with them makes you a visionary. A “Visionary” follows his or her dreams or inner visions within them. This is an “act in faith” as though something is already here before it arrives. At this point, you begin to put into place the details of your overall vision through yourself and others.\n\nIf your inner vision involves helping someone, yourself, or something die, you will need to draw much of your attention inward. This will enable you to create a vision that will help someone or yourself find comfort in becoming more soul than body over time. If your task is to help something or an event die, your job is to transform this experience into something different. Nothing stays the same. We are all in transformation. Transformation means to go beyond form. It is out of the formless all things become form. Everyone of us have this capacity.\n\nSomehow, in the midst of change and sharing our joys and our sorrows, our hearts meet to care. This is the level of soul care and soul healing not meant to be understood, but rather, embraced.

Cave paintings, that are dated at around 30,000 years old, depict a man with the head of a stag, and a pregnant woman standing in a circle with eleven other people.\n\nModern American Wicca has its roots in British Wicca, brought to the United States in the late 1950’s by English and American initiates of Gardnerian, Alexandrian and Celtic Wicca. These are different forms of Wiccan tradition. All of these cultures form part and parcel of the history of Wicca.\n\nThe ancient Greek Mysteries of Eleusis, Italian Mysteries of Rome, Etruria and the general countryside, Mysteries of Egypt and Persia before Islam, and various Babylonian, Assyrian and other mid-eastern Mysteries also find a place in the history of Wicca and its beliefs and traditional practices. Perhaps the best way to describe Wicca is to call it a modern religion, based on ancient witchcraft traditions. But do bear in mind that not all those who practice witchcraft today are Wiccas.\n\nWicca is a both a belief system and a way of life. Over the years information about how Wiccan ancestors lived and worshipped has been lost due to actions of the medieval church. However, modern Wiccas have tried to reconstruct the history of Wicca in an effort to lay the foundation for their practices.\n\nDuring ancient times Wicca was called “The Craft of the Wise”. This name was derived from the fact that most Wiccas aligned themselves with the forces of nature. They also had knowledge of herbs and medicines, gave council and were important in the village and community as Shamanic healers and leaders. The history of Wicca indicates that Wiccas once had a prized place in society which is quite a contrast to how they are viewed today.\n\nAncient Wiccas felt that man was not superior to nature, the earth and its creatures. Instead they were only one aspect of the world. The idea of sustainable development to maintain balance and equilibrium was central to the belief systems of the ancient Wicca. The history of Wicca is a far cry from the way that man views the earth today.\n\nIn the last several hundred years, witchcraft and witches have been incorrectly labeled as evil and unrighteous. Where do these ideas that form so much a part of the history of Wicca originate? Some Wiccas believe that the medieval church of the 15th through 18th centuries created these myths.\n\nThis was done in an effort to covert people to Christianity. The history of Wicca contains many stories of the persecution of witches based on so called “evil” practices.\n\nAnother theory about the history of Wicca is that as medical science became more prominent in society those who did these initial studies did not understand female physiology, especially menstruation. This “mystery” seemed to fit in with the churches agenda in labeling healers as evil heathens and placing power and respect in the hands of male physicians.\n\nMany of these myths and superstitions have survived in modern times giving The Craft a bad name. While Wicca is essentially witchcraft, those who practice it usually do not refer to it as such because of these negative connotations. The history of Wicca is important since it is the persecution of those who practiced it that has led to its current ethic of “religious freedom first”.',NULL,215,'4',0,0,2,'2021-07-30',NULL,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,'2021-07-30 07:59:37','2021-12-01 16:30:25'),(244,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0.00,'25',NULL,'Bad Company Corrupts Good Character','In 1 Corinthians 15:33, Paul wrote: “Do not be misled: Bad company corrupts good character.” This statement should be your guiding light when selecting your next roommates.\n\nIn the same way that your family influenced you growing up, the people you live with now will also change the way you speak, act and think. This is great news if you pick solid, Christian roommates who will help you to grow. Proverbs 27:17 says that “As iron sharpens iron, so one man sharpens another.”\n\nHowever, the influence of your roommates can also corrupt your good character according to the verse from 1 Corinthians. Rather than being sharpened, you can be slowly whittled away. The worst part is, this happens slowly and gradually and you may not even realize you’re changing.\n\nSo how can you avoid bad company in your new roommates? Make sure you choose people that you are familiar with. People who you’ve had a chance to watch for a good year or so. This will ensure that you know the person you’re about to move in with. Spend some time with them in a variety of situations. Is there anything questionable about their beliefs or activities? Ask a couple people for advice as well.

This is most likely the case if you’re moving into a dorm your first year of college. You’re really going to have to rely on God to provide you with someone who will be good company. Either way, it may be good to have some up front conversations to lay down a framework for what your apartment/dorm will be like. You can let your roommate know, gently of course, that drugs and heavy drinking aren’t cool with you and that you’re not really into partying too much. Don’t come across as self-righteous and your roommate will understand.\n\nIf you’re in a situation where you’ve been thrown in with a roommates with bad character, find some support outside of your dorm. Join a church nearby or find an on-campus group to hang out with. A group that can sharpen you and give you advice and help. Through them, you might even have an opportunity to change your roommate into good company.',NULL,148,'4',0,0,1,'2021-07-30',NULL,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,'2021-07-30 08:06:02','2021-07-31 18:43:33'),(245,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0.00,'25',NULL,'Effect Of Prayers On Our Life','What are prayers? To pray means to convey a request to God. Those who believe that there is no God, can still pray to the higher power in who they have belief. But to say that there is no God, makes us feel very lonely at times. At times of crisis, who will you approach? Your friends might have left you. Your family might have deserted you. Who is left? There is God.\n\nWhat is the first effect of prayer? The first effect is that we at least begin believing that someone who can help us, is listening to us. That gives a great support. Because you no longer feel very helpless or lonely. You have got a friend who is all powerful and who can help you. With prayer we call for that help. The deeper the prayer, the earlier the help arrives. A prayer made in total faith can do wonders. But it all boils down to faith. And faith is a matter of individual belief. No science can comment about faith.\n\nWe send good wishes when some one falls sick or for someone who is facing tough times. How do prayers help in that situation? Here we are not making a selfish prayer, but asking for help for some one else. Collective prayers will surely reach God, and he will surely respond to them in his own way. His way may be different than our way, but respond he will. There is no doubt about that. This again is a matter of personal faith.\n\nImagine a man dying of cancer and family left with no hope. If every member of the family prays at that time, that member will also not feel very helpless and hope will always remain. Without prayers, all hope is lost. Wishing Good Luck, wishing for earlier recovery and inspiring a friend are all ways to connect with the higher power. Such wishes and prayers never go waste. Call God, and request him to help, the help will arrive if your prayer is made with faith and is heart felt.',NULL,133,'4',0,0,1,'2021-07-30',NULL,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,'2021-07-30 08:08:50','2021-07-31 18:43:39'),(246,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0.00,'25',NULL,'Psychic Attack Spiritual Purification And Cord Cutting','Energy stealers are everywhere! They are your family members, your friends and they are your co-workers and YOU may even be one yourself. A more common name is a Psychic Vampire and we all know what vampires do! In this case the vampire is sucking our vital energy, depleting us and causing us to become unhealthy emotionally, physically, mentally and spiritually. Spiritual purification and cord cutting are some tools that can keep the vampires away!\n\nWhat does the term ‘Psychic Vampire’ mean anyway? A psychic vampire is a person that steals other people’s energies because they are living their life in victim consciousness and believe that everything happens ‘to’ them. Living in this manner is very dis-empowering. Therefore in order for them to feel better about themselves they need to attach themselves to another person’s energy field. In order for this ‘vampire’ to attach themselves to your energy body, they form cords attaching the two of you together. When they need a boost, they unconsciously steal your energy instead of using their own! These cords are also like highways and run both ways! That means that you will also receive their energy whether it is positive or negative. If they have a headache, you may also develop a headache. It they are depressed, you may become depressed. If they are angry, you may become angry and so on. As you can see this can be very detrimental to your health. At an unconscious level, you have allowed the vampire or vampires to attach themselves to your energy body through these cords. These cords are not visible to the naked eye but they can be seen with the psychic third eye. These cords prevent you from really being the real you! It is imperative that these cords be severed and sometimes a spiritual purification is required for your well-being and also for the growth of the other person.\n\nHow do we recognize a Psychic Vampire? Some traits of the dis-empowered energy stealer are:\n\n– feels lonely or abandoned\n\n– feels they have been rejected\n\n– needs constant reassurance\n\n– never feels satisfied\n\n– doesn’t like to be alone\n\n– seeks nurturing or feels they need to be taken care of\n\n– low energy and fatigued\n\n– they have a poor me attitude\n\n– is a drama king or queen\n\n– constant talker that never allows you to speak\n\n– needs you to be their therapist or rescuer fixing their problems\n\n– the blamer making you feel guilty about things\n\n– vindictive by putting you down\n\n– a person that is unhappy a lot\n\n– tries controlling you or your life\n\n– manipulates you to get things their way\n\nHow do I know if I am being psychically attacked?\n\n– dizziness\n\n– loss of energy\n\n– muscle tension\n\n– mental confusion\n\n– headaches\n\n– chronic fatigue\n\n– sleep disturbances\n\n– irritability\n\n– depressed mood\n\n– physical illness\n\n– small diminishing aura\n\n– leaks, holes and/or tears in your aura\n\n– and a whole lot more!\n\nI know, you are now thinking that is almost everyone alive! Unfortunately, too many people are simply not aware of their energetic bodies and how they operate. Once people start taking responsibility for creating their own lives and taking back their personal power this will not be an epidemic. (Granted other conditions also can be the cause of these symptoms besides being psychically attacked.) Those that psychically attack others either do this consciously or subconsciously. Either way it is detrimental to your health, in all areas of your energetic being, physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually.\n\nHow do I protect myself from this? First you need to become aware of which individuals deplete your energy and limit your contact with them. But simply not being in their physical presence does not stop them from draining you! Know that not all people attacking you are people that you know either! Secondly, you need to release all the negative emotions that you carry within yourself. If you hold anger, hurt, jealousy etc. inside your being, it is like you are shackled to a ball and chain, holding you hostage with your own creation! Releasing of all negative emotions brings freedom as fear is the robber of peace. Why must I do this? Because any disharmony in our four energetic bodies will cause us to be vulnerable, so that darkness and confusion can enter. Being aware of this is empowering. I stress this, do not go into fear now that you are aware of this. Simply take the steps to protect yourself. Darkness consists of anything that is of a lower/heavier vibration such as anger, fear, depression, jealousy, hatred etc. When angry thoughts are directed at you, they can penetrate your weak and vulnerable areas like arrows. What happens is they take away your clarity and fill you with confusion and drain your energy. Following are some tools to empower yourself from Psychic Vampires.\n\nHere is a simple cord cutting exercise. Cord cutting should be done on a daily basis and much more often when we are going through a stressful period in our life. These cords should be cut from our loved ones as well. No cord attached to anyone or thing is good!\n\n– Take some deep cleansing breaths. In through the nose and out through the mouth. Call upon Arch Angel Michael and ask him for his assistance in cutting all cords that are attached to your being. Visualize Michael swirling his sword around your entire being severing all the cords. Know that no cord can remain intact and they are returning to where they came from. When you feel Michael has completed this process, thank him for his assistance. It is done. Easy as that!\n\nHere are some physical steps for purification.\n\n– Burn all relevant photographs or objects holding memories of the person, place or situation.\n\n– Write down all feelings of frustration, anger, hurt, fear, etc., and burn the paper, flush it down the toilet or bury it. Please don’t give it to the person! Repeat this step as often as necessary.\n\n– Clear all the clutter from every room of your home. Rule of thumb. If you haven’t used in 6 months it’s not likely you will! Get rid of it.\n\n– Clean and if necessary redecorate your home. Bringing nature indoors is wonderful energy!\n\n– Check there are no books in your bookshelves or pictures on your walls that have negative energy. Surround yourself with high vibrational objects, spiritual books, spiritual pictures, plants, fresh flowers etc.\n\n– Sprinkle holy water in all rooms starting at the center spiraling outwards.\n\n– Smudge with sage, cedar and sweetgrass and invoke the help of God, the Ascended Masters, the Great White Brother and Sisterhood, the Archangels and Angels, your Higherself and I AM Presence.\n\n– Play sacred music and sing, chant OM or say The Lord’s Prayer.\n\n– Cleanse and purify your crystals and dedicate them to the Light.\n\n– Light candles and use high vibrational pure essential oils.\n\nYou now have the tools and knowledge to take back your personal power.

It was part of the electromagnetic wave spectrum that allowed one to perceive an electromagnetic wave as heat, light , radio waves, or other electromagnetic radiations depending on the frequency of its vibrations. This spectrum had been well-defined by the equations of the English physicist James Clerk Maxwell in 1864.\n\nMan’s biology was reduced to a mechanical system albeit of extreme complexity, and thought was perceived to be but an epiphenomenon of the mechanical brain.\n\nAll this was very hygienic, logical, and comforting. It allowed to view the so-called invisible world of spiritual forces or entities as a personal unproven hypothesis, and permitted the justification of atheistic concept to be scientifically sound. Basically it allowed for purely atheistic politico-philosophies alike communism to find a sympathetic resonance within the “intelligentsia” and the masses.\n\nIt also gave a great mechanistic impetus and approach to the fields of biology, microbiology, psychology, neurobiology, and the allopathic technical mechanistic approach to the health sciences. Technology was “king” and the understanding of interactions between well-defined separated systems would bring the possible conquest of disturbances and imperfections in the “machinery” of biological entities.\n\nMan having created a new religion called “science”, which revered himself and his intellect, had the perception of having attained a Godlike control over nature.\n\nBy the end of 19th century the ultraviolet catastrophe – as it came to be known – put this whole hygienic view of the world in question, and the theory of “quanta” of Max Planck was introduced in 1900. The German physicist Max Planck introduced the notion of packets of energy that he called “quanta” in order to explain why the wavelength (color) of the radiation given off by heated objects did not rise in a continuous manner but in discontinuous spurts from value to value as they grew hotter. Danish physicist Niels Bohr, who was to become later one of the fathers of the “Manhattan Project” that developed the first US A-bomb during WWII, used in 1913 the theory of “quanta” of energy in order to prove that the whole world of atoms was full of “quantum” jumps. An electron could jump from one level of energy (so-called orbit) to another without appearing in-between these states. Discontinuity had been introduced in our equation of the universe!\n\nIn 1905 Albert Einstein defined light as made of quanta of energy or particles that he coined “photons” in his famous paper explaining the photoelectric effect for which he received a Nobel prize in 1923. He nevertheless acknowledged that light could also be defined as a wave, depending on the mode of observation used in a chosen experiment, and the particle/wave duality was introduced in our attempts to grasp the mysteries of nature.\n\nThe new physics of the beginnings of the twentieth century gave a mortal blow to the deterministic principles of the old school of thought. Time and space became relative notions according to the theory of relativity of Albert Einstein. Quantum physics stated that all particles of matter could be viewed either as material bodies or as waves. It allowed for one electron (or any other particle) to be in two locations at once (double slit experiment), and proved that one could not predict the next location of a particle by knowing its present one.\n\nIn the strange world of quantum physics, particles dematerialized themselves into waves (such as in transistors) and rematerialized themselves later into particles. This depended on the type of experiment they were subjected to, and most importantly: the choice made by a conscious observer as to how he or she would view these particles.\n\nTo most theorists, the phenomena of nature existed only as determined states as a conscious observer witnessed them, either directly, or through the artifacts of a measuring device. Quantum mechanics was born, and with it our view of reality would be forever changed.\n\nIn order to comprehend events in the phenomenal world, one needed to introduce a major variable that had until then been ignored: The consciousness (self reflective thought) of the observer. Without the perception of a material world by a conscious entity, there were great doubts as to the existence of that material reality independently of its observation.\n\nIn other words we make a potential reality manifest itself by our choices, even retroactively through time and immediately across the perceived infinite space, as the two experiments mentioned hereafter have proven, to the surprise of most physicists. Or, in other words, volition and free will operate outside the confines of time/space, and our impression of making choices is but a delayed awareness of events that higher levels of our minds have already made for us and therefore project to our awareness (ego) as a holographic packet of sensory information, post facto. We are therefore, at a higher level, the maker (subject) of our reality projected to one’s self (object) within the web of probabilities of the quantum world that we “materialize” for both the subject and the object that are but two mirrors of one same reality: Consciousness, defined as self -reflective awareness.\n\nVery advanced “remote viewers” know at which points volition is part of the higher levels of one’s self and at which points it is made available to the lower (conscious level), as the quantum self or higher self merges with the lower self (ego).\n\nOur courses attempts to allow the conscious part (reactive sensory apparatus operating as intellect) and the much higher vibratory mind (deep subconscious level) to merge with each other in awareness in order to allow a human individual to be more in control of one’s reality and probable future. At the level of the higher mind time/space is instantly bridged. “Remote Viewing” and especially “Remote Influencing” allows one to connect to that level.\n\nMr. O’Donnell only mentions quantum physics in order to allow for the comforting view of reality of most individuals to be shattered and at the very least questioned. Each one is to find his or her own truth, using eventually his or her own path. The course is only meant as a guide to a new world, an opening to a new way of viewing and experiencing reality.\n\nIn 1982 at the Institute of Applied Physics and Theoretical Optics at the University of Paris, France, the team of physicists composed of Alain Aspect, Jean Dalibard and Gerard Roger made what may prove to be the greatest scientific discovery of this century. They proved experimentally that the world is non-local or non-separable. This is equivalent to saying that space, as we perceive it to be, does not exist, but is an illusion of our senses. Projected by whom? This is the big question that science tries to answer.\n\nIn the same field of quantum theory, time is not only relative but one can experimentally change the past, as the delayed choice experiment, carried out by scientists in the 80’s at the University of Maryland and the University of Munich has proven.\n\nAlthough this all seems to belong to the realm of science-fiction, it is a reality, albeit hard to accept, for all the minds that dwell in the world of the quanta: a world full of seemingly contradictions, surprises, and a certain sense of humor.\n\nAll modern disciplines are nowadays affected by it, short maybe of modern biology, neurobiology and surprisingly psychology that are still embracing a mechanistic view of thought and have not, as yet, been able to define it.\n\nQuantum physics gave us the invention of the atomic bomb, the transistor, the computer chip, laser and devices using laser light as a conduct for information, Josephson junctions in supercomputers, superconductors etc.\n\nYou should never doubt your natural-born ability to operate at such a high vibratory level of thought. This ability has been proven since antiquity, and is still utilized successfully by highly secretive intelligence units belonging to the major world powers.\n\nThis is one case where a dose of skepticism in the field of thought orientation and exploration is unhealthy, and the fear of ridicule even more so. You have to become open-minded, as a child is. All major shifts in scientific thought have incurred the ire of the static-minded old Praetorian Guard of proven inadequate sclerotic systems that are beginning to hit too many walls loaded with points of singularity.\n\nThe methods taught in our courses are probably part of the dawn of a new paradigm shift in scientific thinking that will revolutionize and change the “old classical scientific concepts” of the late 19th century that still rule for most of us our interpretation of our perceived material reality. This will have major implications in the natural and health sciences, the biological perceptions and their assumed correlations, all other phenomenal science, and the understanding of what the mind is.\n\nIf we are in the process of constantly creating our reality by thinking about it in an individualized and global manner, and that science reflects but a snapshot of our attempt at understanding our Creation, a major shift in our thought- perception will induce totally different ways at experiencing the phenomenal world and controlling it to our desires.\n\nAll aspects of our lives in this new Millennium will, most likely, be profoundly transformed by it.\n\nThe introduction of consciousness as a major factor in the equation of reality by modern quantum physics is at the core of one of the major paradox of so-called psychic research. According to quantum physics, the thought of the observer has an influence upon the result of an experiment. Therefore, if we are co-creator of our reality by mere thought, the natural imbued skepticism of many scientists and their methodologies introduce a negative bias in the results that they would obtain in thought experiment such as “remote viewing” etc.\n\nIn other words, in order to achieve 100% success at proving the efficacy of “remote viewing or influencing ” one would need to deal with scientists and tests subjects that are of the firm belief of the easy achievement of such mental feats, which would automatically be called a bias experimental protocol by the skeptical scientific community. That is why the best results at remote viewing were always achieved within intelligence and military secret units that pragmatically only cared about bridging time and space effectively using mental technologies, and were not the least concerned about peer recognition and the fear of being ridiculed.',NULL,679,'4',0,0,0,'2021-07-30',NULL,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,'2021-07-30 08:23:09','2021-07-31 07:58:40'),(248,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0.00,'25',NULL,'Appealing For A Psychic Reading','Nowadays, you will find more people choosing to seek guidance from a psychic helpline than from psychoanalyst or from a priest. Perhaps the advice of the priest is too restrictive and, in some parts of the world, the church does not manage to follow up the speed of the modern life. Psychological counseling may be too expensive and too pretentious on occasion. People seem to find the idea of a psychic reading more approachable and helpful.\n\nA psychic helpline seems to have many benefits. First and foremost, just like other forms of counseling, it helps people divert the responsibility of personal decisions from themselves to a “professional” psychic, to someone outside the situation, endowed with special psychic capacities and who can have a more objective opinion on events. A psychic helpline offers more confidentiality than any other form of counseling: nobody will know who you are at the other end of the line and you don’t have to face the psychic you talk to. A psychic helpline is available around the clock and you can always switch to another psychic helpline if the services of the one you are currently using do not satisfy you any longer. In addition, using a psychic helpline may turn out to be much cheaper than making use of other forms of counseling.\n\nWhen you call a psychic helpline, you get to talk to a professional psychic that is ready to listen to your question and concerns. The psychic will listen to you and then will ask for a few questions in order to be able to build your psychic reading. A psychic reading is one of the reasons you call the psychic helpline in the first place. While you may call simply because you just need someone to talk to and a psychic can be a sympathetic ear, you usually call because you look for specific advice which comes in the form of the psychic reading.\n\nA psychic reading will start from your profile and the question you are interested in. The personal information you need to provide a psychic helpline in order to get a psychic reading is usually related to your date and place of birth, or other important dates in your life. Perhaps they will ask for your first name and initials, but usually the information you provide to the psychic helpline should not get too specific. The form your psychic reading takes depends on your preferences, on whether you are interested in numerology or horoscopes, in Tarot or i-Ching, clairvoyance or dream interpretation.\n\nA very popular form of psychic reading is a personal horoscope which can require as little as your date of birth and provide you with information about the events to follow in your life. A similar form of psychic reading is the numerological chart, working with quite limited information too, and providing you with the main features of your destiny. You may even get these types of psychic reading in written form after you have called the psychic helpline and requested for them. Other forms of psychic reading, such as the Tarot cards, may be done over the phone. You may even need to meet the psychic in person, in which case the psychic helpline is just the starting point in your venture, merely putting you in touch with the psychic.\n\nWhile a psychic helpline may be the easiest and most popular way to get a psychic reading, you must be warned that there have been cases when a psychic helpline was proven to be set up to take advantage of people. The people employed as psychics were frauds and if you got a psychic reading there, it may not state the truth. Indeed, there are reasons to question the whole practice of getting a psychic reading, but scams are everywhere and, if you manage to stay away from them, you might get to find out exactly what you are looking for.\n\nBefore calling a psychic helpline and requesting for a psychic reading, you may want to search for the answers within yourself. It is better to try to know yourself and try to make decisions based on what you know and feel. In the end you will still have to do that no matter the amount of help you maye get from someone else. Of course, a psychic can help you do just that (just like a psychologist), but you will need a lot of patience anyway.',NULL,117,'4',0,0,0,'2021-07-30',NULL,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,'2021-07-30 10:34:56','2021-07-31 07:43:10'),(250,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0.00,'25',NULL,'Angels And Spirit Guides','Even when you feel as though you are completely alone, there are Divine Companions who are always with you. Before your incarnation they chose to accompany you through your lifetime- from the moment of your first breath- until your last. Spirit Guides are highly evolved beings that have completed the cycle of birth and death in the physical plane and are now serving as teachers and guides to further elevate their vibrations. They are as “real” as you are- they are just vibrating at another level and reside in another plane of existence.\n\nThey work to guide you by working through your dreams and intuition. That quiet voice you hear is often the voice of your teachers and guides. They may also make themselves known to you through signs and symbols. For me, when I am at a crossroads in my life or journeying though a personal or emotional challenge- I find feathers everywhere. I also see feather tattoos, hawks and hear certain songs. It is a reminder for me to be still and listen to the guidance of my own personal guides. The feathers are representative of the energy of my guides- one being a powerful Shaman and the others are from the Angelic Realm.\n\nSome individuals have one guide and others have multitudes- much of this depends on the path and purpose of your life. For instance, a teacher/professor may have several guides- one to guide them through the academic nature of their profession and others to assist them with the great emotional requirements of performing such an important task. A policeman, fireman, or soldier will often have a “team” of warriors guiding and protecting them. Much of who your guides are indicative of your own personal journey though life.\n\nSpirit guides are almost never a loved one who has passed away. Although our loved ones stay with us in spirit and we can contact them, they do not serve the same role as a “spirit guide”. Some individuals have Archangels and Angels as spirit guides who are always with them. Yet, the presence of Angels does not always mean they are your spirit guides. Angels can be called in times of distress to assist you for a short time. If you have an Archangel or Angel as a guide, chances are your mission in life is a complex one. Through my experience with being a psychic reader and spiritual teacher- I have found that individuals with a challenging life path often have Angels as spirit guides.\n\nYour spirit guide is always with you, whether you acknowledge their presence or not. You cannot call them to you or send them away- they are part of you and your journey. However, you can choose to gain the knowledge of who they are and what their role in your life is. You can interact with your spirit guides in a more proactive way. If you want to know who your guides are, just ask. Get in a quiet and meditative space and ask that they reveal themselves to you. Do not get discouraged if you do not figure it out right away. Beings from the spiritual realm often communicate through signs and symbols. Once you ask- you must trust your own wisdom. Pay attention to the pictures that appear in your mind. If you see a man in a suit- stay with that- it could be he is a philosopher or scientist. You may see a Native American Indian, a Buddhist Monk or you may see nothing at all. Keep your mind and intuition open. Pay attention to things that keep coming up after you have asked that they reveal who they are. If you are having a challenge discovering who they are you can also contact a professional psychic/intuitive to assist you.\n\nWorking with your spirit guides can be an incredible tool for your own personal and spiritual growth. Unlike beings who are in the physical- their wisdom and advice is not influenced by the “world”. They dwell in a higher vibrational plane and the mundane particulars of your situation are not relevant. For example- if you seek guidance from your spirit guide regarding a relationship- they will lead you to focus on what you are learning, what you need to learn, what you are teaching your partner, and what is the true meaning of your relationship. The fact that they leave the toilet seat up or are terrible at budgeting the household finances will be irrelevant. The information that you will be provided with- will be actions that YOU can take to gain more understanding. You can also ask your Spirit Guides to assist you in physical healing. Before you go to sleep, ask that as you are sleeping- you receive healing.\n\nYou are never alone. Never. Take faith in knowing and understanding that there is so much magic and mystery in this life. Just for a moment let the “world” disappear. Raise your vibration and allow the beautiful gifts of spirit wash over you. Life is so much more than what we see. Open your spiritual eyes and hearts and you will discover a world of wisdom, beauty and peace that you never knew existed. Of course, you can always choose to not believe. It is always your choice. But, why not? Why not step into another level of existence? Why not believe in magic? You do not have to announce it to the office, but you can embrace the wonders of spirit in your own heart. It will envelope you in a light of love and understanding- and will mysteriously transform you to a more connected and loving being.

Many of us at times, become very helpless about a problem and leave the work to God. Let God do whatever He wants now. I am out of this. I cannot do anything anymore. I leave this to God. This happens many times in our life when we feel helpless. Talk to a terminal cancer patient who has given up all the hopes, and you will hear only about God. Am I correct?\n\nWe also leave many others to God. Sometimes knowingly and many more times, without any knowledge. Let me elaborate. There is so much misery in the world, so much poverty and sickness. A majority of us have left these suffering people to God. Am I making sense? We make no effort to help. This is what I meant by saying unknowingly. We are not bad, but we are so overwhelmed with our own life and have become so immune to misery around us that we make no effort to help these people, but leave them to God. Some of us don’t take this attitude, but try and do whatever we can. Like Mother Teresa did. Such people become saints.\n\nNow let us talk of something very cruel. How can leaving someone to God be cruel? This sounds contradictory. But this happens. Let us see how. A mother leaving her new born child on the street corner. Why? She never wanted the child. She does not know what to tell the world about the child. She has prestige to keep in society. She has her own problems. So what can she do? She leaves the helpless child to God. Oh, Lord, In all your mercy, please take care of my child. I leave my child to you. And she walks away acting as if nothing happened. How do you look at this?\n\nWhy did she sacrifice a newborn to her false sense of prestige? Why did she give society more importance than her helpless child? Why did she want to keep this facade of truth? Did she make God happy with her action? What do you call this. If this is not cruel, then what else is this?\n\nWhy did she not pray to God – Oh, God, I have this lovely child. I don’t know how to bring up this child. I don’t know what to tell my relatives about this child. I don’t know how to face many problems that will come while bringing up this child? Please help me. I cannot leave my child alone. I will bring up my child myself. Please help me. Please have your mercy on me?\n\nWhy don’t such people leave themselves to mercy of God? Why do they try to get up, try to earn, try to prepare food, and try to feed themselves? Why do they go to a doctor when they are sick? Why don’t they always say, God, I am sick, please take care. God, I am hungry. Please take care. They don’t. Because they don’t have total faith in Lord. The faith and surrender that makes them leave their every life issue to God is absent. But these same mothers leave someone totally helpless to the mercy of God. Such mothers are cruel and ruthless.

But to answer to the question of how can it be so…well… to be frank, I have no straight answers. All I can say is that the guiding hand of the intelligence of soul/higher self/Source works in mysterious ways. An understanding of our dreams is the most direct way of tapping into this cosmic intelligence. This is one of the easier method when compared to other means such as clairvoyance training and other psychic developments. The reason for this ease is because most of us dream!\n\nInterestingly, dream interpretation can also be applied in other areas too. It can be and has been used successfully to interpret the symbols of our clairvoyant vision while in meditation. Understanding the symbology can assist one in bridging a transition onto higher and more abstract means of knowing.\n\nThere are certain skills that I feel is important for successful dream interpretation. One of which is a developed intuition. Unfortunately, this faculty is something that no dream interpretation software or tool can have. It is something that only we ourselves can nurture.\n\nIntuition is what binds and creates recognisable connections to the seemingly unrelated dream visions and symbols.This in turn structures the connections into a cohesive and meaningful message.\n\nIntuition is not mental reasoning. It is simply that inner knowing of feeling/sensing that is beyond logic and reasoning. Intuition is in fact a real cognitive process. Unfortunately our modern civilisation is heavily ‘mental-rationalisation driven’ and therefore is not in the capacity to validate a higher order process such as intuition. In another word, we have been placing too much emphasis on logic, proving and reasoning.\n\nIntuition, sometimes it doesn’t tell you the outcomes of events. In my cases, it is simply an inner knowing that explains and provides answers.\n\nIf the thoughts are those of how superior one really is and is smacked with elitism and pride, then one better take a closer assessment, before getting too carried away. These thoughts might not be intuitions. If they imply things like “You will be rich and famous if you do this’ or ‘she must be wrong as I am smarter’, do double check. That thought may be coming from the part of the ego/personality associated with body-mind survival.\n\nThank you for reading.',NULL,145,'4',0,0,1,'2021-07-30',NULL,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,'2021-07-30 11:17:08','2021-08-05 04:33:48'),(255,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0.00,'25',NULL,'Buoyant Mind No More Tears','One can not imbibe steadfastness and buoyant spirits unless he has peace of mind within himself blooming with love.

Here are the Annual Forecasts and suggested Fengshui &amp; Crystal Remedies that you may need for the coming “New Year 2006 : Bing Xu, the Year of the Yang Red Fire Dog” :\n\nCAREER :\n\nIf you work hard without excessive ambitions, you could gain more power and eventually a better status. But your income may not that proportionate. The upward swing in career would be quite reasonable, if you continue to remain courteous and refused to get involved over annoying gossips that keep poking at you. Your subordinates and colleagues might form an effective coalition against you; your superiors may turn against you. Avoid immersing in internal politics at office. Always work behind the scene and avoid the forefronts. Refrain from signing documents in a haste and when you do sign, make sure that you have fully read between the lines. Your well knit social network will come to your rescue, when you need to be rescued. Opportunities and fortune will decline in the second half but you will get unexpected help from the opposite sex, to get through. All the same, this is a fit case for displaying an image or icon of Green Tara, to tide over the obstacles. Be careful when you delegate work to your subordinates. Chances of wrong decisions there could undermine your efforts and earn you a bad reputation. Handling issues and people will take up a lot of your time and you will be judged by others instantly. Be wary of so called friends, who will be out to malign you. There could be a lot of unresolved issues continuously pouncing on you. Possibilities of back-stabbing exist. Some of you might face situational blackmailing because of unresolved financial disputes. Females will have a better year than males. Wearing a single or double termianted Amethyst Pendant will ease you out of many problems. Light up a red bulb in the center of your home. You can also install the icon of Kuan Kung to get guided and protected. If you are a clerk or government official or in creative field, you will do much better than others.\n\nYou are in punishment formation with the Tai Sui this year, so display the statue of a Three Generations Dragon Head Turtle alongwith a photograph of the presiding Year Authority of 2006 in the North West, to minimise the negativities of gossips and scandals. You should also personally wear a Fengshui Rabbit Pendant or place the statue of a Rabbit in the East. (The position of Tai Sui corresponds to North West this year. Tai Sui is also popularly called as Grand Duke of Jupiter and is an intangible energy body of war-like nature that should not be disturbed.)\n\n\n\nMONEY :\n\nCashflow would be reasonably good, though not consistent. The year is full of unexpected expenses and it would be difficult to retain the incoming money. Not a good year for making large or long term investments. Do not gamble or indulge yourself in financial speculation, though some of you do have good lottery luck this year. Vigilance is needed as the chances of money loss through theft or an affair is a reality too. Keep a set of PaKua Horoscope Coins in your pocket and a set of Dragon &amp; Phoenix Coins at your home.\n\n\n\nHEALTH :\n\nThe urge to eat more food and good food will be on the increase. Be careful with what you eat. You are forewarned of problems linked to digestion, diarrhea, abdomenal and gastrointestinal infections. Common headaches, sneezing, cold, flu, viral infections and some allergies also are indicated. Drink and smoke less. Some of you might get problems related to throat and trachea. Exercise and meditate. If any of your old illness resurfaces, go in for medical treatment immediately. Hang a large sized original Chinese Sacred Fruit called the Wou-Lou or Hoo-Loo in your dining room, from the ceiling.\n\n\n\nLOVE :\n\nNormal love luck, if you keep it that way. To keep it that way, you have to resist temptations to be irresponsible. Active social life may bring in gossips that can hurt you rather badly. It would be a good idea to keep a Rooster figure in the South West of your bedroom. Singles need to take a lot of initiatives to get their life partners.\n\nBeneficial Crystal : Turquoise, for 2006\n\nGood Relationship with : Rat, Rabbit &amp; Monkey, for 2006\n\n\n\nConflict with : Horse, Dragon &amp; Goat, for 2006\n\nYin/Yang : Yin\n\nA NOTE ABOUT REMEDIES : The above analysis has suggested some remedies/cures for reducing the impact of negative energy and has recommended certain enhancers for increasing and improving upon the beneficial energy.

Often these communications are through what is called the “clair senses.”\n\nClair senses is a collective word, meaning that the Guides’ communication can utilize any of the following types of psychic sensitivity which co-mingles the physical body’s normal five senses.\n\nThe five sense and the clair sense involved are:\n\n\n\nClairaudience\n\nClairaudience are perceive sounds (or words) that a person can actually hear when, in fact, no one is speaking and nothing physical is causing the sounds. The sounds are thought to be impressions that register themselves on the spirillae of the ear’s pineal gland. It is believed that clairaudience sounds go through the same process that normal hearing does, passing through the Third Eye chakra of the head.\n\nClairsavorance\n\n\n\nClairsavorance is translated as clear tasting. The person experiences tastes in the mouth without putting anything physical actually in the mouth.\n\nClairscient\n\nClairscient means to smell a fragrance or odor of a substance which is not physical in nature. For example, you might smell cigarette smoke when you are in a place where it is certain no one is smoking or has smoked.\n\nClairsentience\n\nClairsentience allows a psychic to perceive information as a feeling within the whole body without any other stimuli related to this feeling or information, which comes from within the body, down the kundalini to the stomach area or solar plexus. The stomach area is one of the strongest communication centers that Guides frequently use to communicate.\n\nClairvoyance\n\nClairvoyance means to see into an ethereal dimension without using physical eyes. Some describe it as reaching into another vibration frequency and visually perceive “within the head” something like moving pictures. The third eye area of the forehead is one of the other strongest communication centers that Guides frequently use to communicate.\n\nSince this article is focused on the “belly energies” and psychic abilities, we will narrow our focus to the area of the clairsentience.\n\nIn his historic writings of “Psychic Science,” Sir Oliver Lodge spoke about what he called “clairvoyance or lucidity” and raised the older concepts that were coined as “reading with the pit of the stomach.” According to Lodge, using the stomach or belly area as the channel for psychic communications was an established practice.\n\nThat is an interesting observation when you look more globally at the ancient’s beliefs about the belly. The Chinese called this belly chakra the “chi point,” while the Japanese termed it the “hara” or “ki point.” As the body’s balancing chakra, this area is located one and a half inches below the navel and one and a half inches inward toward the spine. It is the “energy” that the body generates, some call it a power-center.\n\nIn writing this article, I spoke with world renown psychic and author Jane Doherty because as a psychic she experiences a physical phenomena that relates to Sir Oliver Lodge’s concept of “reading with the pit of the stomach.”\n\nWhenever there are ghosts around Jane Doherty, she has an amazing physical reaction to them. The reaction Jane has is that her stomach area actually enlarges by as much as six inches around within seconds. And, Jane tells us that it is extremely painful to her when this happens. If you watch Jane while her stomach expansion is happening, you are going to hear her moaning and see her wincing … and trust me, it is not dramatics … Jane is in definite pain.\n\nWith regards to her expanding tummy, Jane says, “It feels like a contraction when a woman is in labor, but it doesn’t ever release me until the spirit leaves. Instead, the stomach expands as if I was nine months pregnant.” Jane actually describes it as very intense muscle cramps, where her stomach is physically gripped by the ghost, and if you watch, the belly will actually lift up. Jane continues, “Often I can tell by the grip whether it is a female, male or child spirit. It first happened to me in 1990, when I investigated my first haunted house with a researcher.”\n\nPsychic Jane Doherty has this psychic belly experience as she applies her clairsentience skills, but interestingly enough the phenomena only happens when a ghost is present and not when a Guide is present. You can learn more about Jane Doherty’s psychic abilities in her book “Awakening the Mystic Gift: The Surprising Truth About What It Means to Be Psychic,” which chronicles Jane’s own psychic awakening and what it truly means to be psychic. You can also view her expanding stomach area on TLC’s Dead Tenants show in which Jane co-stars. Jane’s book and book club are located at www.Herbal-College.com.\n\nDoreen Virtue, author of “Clairaudience: Hearing Your Angels’ Messages,” says that clairsentients get divine guidance through bodily sensations, such as a tightening of the jaw, fists, stomach or sex organs, and that they intuitively know the specific meaning of these tightening reactions. She further adds that clairsentients receive angelic guidance through an etheric sense of smell, taste, and touch.\n\nRenowned medium John Holland says pointedly that the hot spot for clairsentients is the stomach.\n\nClearly the “belly energies” and “psychic abilities” are intrinsically related as a compliment that helps allow mediums to communicate with Guides, ghosts and other-worldly beings. The stomach area is indeed one of the strongest communication centers frequently use to communicate with that which has no physical form.',NULL,156,'4',0,0,0,'2021-07-30',NULL,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,'2021-07-30 11:31:07','2021-07-31 08:02:49'),(258,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0.00,'25',NULL,'Life After Death Is It Really Necessary That We Prove It','Recently, I came across a book written in 1918 by Arthur Conan Doyle called “The New Revelation”. It was his first book concerning his views on spiritualism and psychic phenomena. I found it fascinating to read, as much of the “proof” that he gathered and retold regarding “life” in the afterlife is still the same as what our psychics, mediums, and other metaphysical researchers of today tell us.\n\nThe fact is, we’ve been receiving proof of an afterlife for centuries. People throughout time have talked about angels, visitations from spirits, ghost entities, poltergeists, and communications from beyond. Stories of reincarnation continue to flood in, many from young children who wouldn’t have had access, nor the understanding, to imagine and produce some of the tales they tell. With our modern medicine and life-saving medical equipment, the occurrences of near death experiences are being brought into the open more and more often. Really, how much more “proof” do we need?\n\nAnd yet…skeptics still abound. What’s more interesting is that various polls and statistics indicate that approximately 80% of the world’s population believes in: life after death, that we have a soul and that it continues to exist after our “physical” deaths, that there is a Heaven, and that there is some sort of creator who watches over us. Out of the 20% left, about half are sitting on the fence and haven’t made up their minds on what to believe. That leaves just 10% of human beings that we need to “convince and show proof too.” In which case I need to ask this question… Why do we need to prove anything to this very small minority of people?\n\nAs I mentioned at the beginning, I had just finished reading Doyle’s “The New Revelation” (you can read the entire book online at our website). While reading, I came across a very interesting statement that he made and one in which we should all think about:\n\n\n\n“…we have reached a point where further proof is superfluous, and where the weight of disproof lies upon those who deny. The very people who clamour for proofs have, as a rule, never taken the trouble to examine the copious proofs which already exist…”\n\nIsn’t that an interesting remark made by someone almost a century ago? “…where the weight of disproof lies upon those who deny…” The proof has been all around us forever and most of us know this. And yet, here we are in the twenty-first century STILL trying to provide proof that there really is a spiritual realm. How about we put the burden of proof on the disbelievers and have them DISPROVE the existence of an afterlife? The reality is that they can’t – there’s too much evidence that indicates that there is more to the existence of “life” than our physcial senses can comprehend. Think about it. Has anyone shown you absolute proof that once you die, that’s it, game over, nothing more exists? Yet, skeptics constantly spout this theory. Well, if this is true, where’s the documented research and proof?\n\nIs there life after death? The thousands upon thousands of thoroughly investigated and documented metaphysical cases point to the fact that there is definitely something beyond the material experiences of our physical realm. The believers in a spiritual afterlife really have nothing left to prove. It’s time we turned the tables and required that the disbelievers prove to the majority of the world that life ends with our physical death.\n\nOh, by the way, good luck with that.',NULL,224,'4',0,0,0,'2021-07-30',NULL,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,'2021-07-30 11:35:33','2021-07-31 07:54:38'),(259,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0.00,'25',NULL,'Annual Forecasts Fengshui Remedies For 2006 Year Of The Yang Red Fire Dog For Tiger Sign','The ancient Chinese Astrology is not only fascinating but also quite accurate.

Many of you will have a good career and a fast pace too. A lot of business people will also expand their activities. But a negative trend could also set in very fast. The unemployed would find a proper job. At the same time, those who thought that they had settled down could find themselves suddenly out of favour with Lady Luck. Sincere and systematic work is of essence. Be humble and do not let frictions develop into arguments. Lack of motivation and focus, irritation at efforts not recognised could eventually make many of you to lose good opportunities, shift professions or business. Some may move their homes too. But wherever you go, rumours will haunt you throughout the year. If you are onto stock markets, real estate agency and MLM, you may not do good. But you have anything to do with civil service, administration and publications, you will do well. If you are in Governmental service, resist illegal activites, or else you may end up with litigation or may even be imprisoned. Be extra careful when you sign in documents of any type. If you are employed, install a Golden Carp in the North and if you are doing business, keep a Dragon &amp; Phoenix statue in the North. Hold your tongue back and ignore insults. Do not take shortcuts, but follow the rules and regulations strictly, to avoid being picked on. Otherwise you may find yourself getting out of control and some of you may end up on the wrong side of the law. Beware of back-stabbers, especially those who are near you. It would be a bright idea for you to wear a Black Tourmalene Crystal Pendant to keep off all these negative energies.\n\n\n\nMONEY :\n\nExcept for those of you in commission based profession, wealth luck is minimal. In fact, you may have to fight hard even for what is rightfully yours. So better avoid impulsive purchases and be prudent when you spend. Do not invest big in stocks. Do not lend to friends. You may have to foot a lot of legal bills this year. To improve cash flow, keep a set of Dragon &amp; Phoenix Coins at home and carry a smaller set in your pocket or purse.\n\n\n\nHEALTH :\n\nTake care of your mental health. Do not allow the work pressure to translate into depression and hallucinations. Meditate whenever possible. Avoid visiting hospitals and funerals. If you can eat, sleep and rest well and in time, all is okay. Otherwise you may end up with a lot of digestion problems. Some of you may experience tooth and kidney problems.\n\n\n\nLOVE :\n\nNot an ideal year for good marriages to happen. If you are single, enjoy companionship but refrain from crossing the limits. If you are married, resist seductions or you will regret later. Ignore gossips. Trust and faith will be tested. Love triangles will eat into good and time-tested relationships. Many families will see separations. Married couple should keep the combined statue of Dragon &amp; Phoenix or a pair of pink Mandarin Ducks in the South West of their bedroom.\n\nBeneficial Crystal : Green Aventurine, for 2006\n\nGood Relationship with : Horse, Dog &amp; Dragon, for 2006\n\nConflict with : Snake, Ox, Monkey &amp; Rabbit, for 2006\n\nYin/Yang : Yang\n\nA NOTE ABOUT REMEDIES : The above analysis has suggested some remedies/cures for reducing the impact of negative energy and has recommended certain enhancers for increasing and improving upon the beneficial energy.

From my understanding, we are much more than that. Each one of us has a higher aspect. This higher aspect has been typically called the Higher Self. If I am not wrong, others have also referred to it as the oversoul or overself.\n\nWho and what is the Higher Self? From my experience, the Higher Self is the intelligence and wisdom aspect of our own self. Ironically, the Higher Self is impersonal and does not have a ‘sense of self’ like the way our personality is. Nevertheless, it serves as a guiding aspect for the personality or ego.\n\nCan this elusive higher self be contacted? Yes and typically it is done through meditation or some other altered states of consciousness.\n\nA little bit about me. Back in the late 1990s, I discovered that if I am thinking hard about a subject that is of a spiritual inquiry, I will sometimes receive visions that attempt to answer my queries. Mostly the visions are symbolic. Higher self will communicate by impulsing symbols and visions that form messages into my awareness.\n\nAn example of such transmissions:\n\n\n\nSome years ago, I was contemplating on the nature of the cycle of reincarnation. Will lost souls be forever looped within the lower realm? (According to many Eastern Beliefs, Beings who had not attained enlightenment will be caught in a vicious circle of perpetual birth and rebirth.) Suddenly, out of nowhere, I received a transmission from beyond my conscious mind. It came as a ‘package’… like a burst of images/symbols and moods. Very fast, split second impressions. The package seemed to be received by the right hemisphere of my brain. My brain instinctively attempted to interpret the transmission before I lose it. How do I know it wasn’t my imagination? Well, firstly I do not think in pictures. I think in languages; English, Mandarin, etc. Secondly, the transmitted images were performing a ‘dual-split’ to my consciousness. That is, the images are simultaneously overlaying my visual perception of the environment around me. Well, a ‘dual-split’ in consciousness is definitely not the usual way my mind works!\n\nThe animated vision was set against a light blue background. There were rings or bands of a lighter colour moving towards a centre point. Because the transmission was so fast, I think I might had lose some vital information. Anyway, here’s my interpretation. Please understand that it was my physical brain that did this interpretation. As such I can never be to sure about the accuracy of my interpretation:\n\n“The transmission is attempting to correct errors or rather incompleteness within my understanding of the scheme of things. The cycle of reincarnation is never meant to last forever. Eventually all will return back to the Source or essence. “\n\n\n\nWell, that transmission was many years ago. My understanding on that matter has been refined since then. However, the transmission was appropriate (to my level of understanding) at that time.\n\nOver the years, these vision transmissions from Higher Self, together with the guidance of Enlightened Physical Teachers, have helped me to understand the dynamics consciousness and the universe greatly.\n\nThank you for reading.',NULL,250,'4',0,0,0,'2021-07-30',NULL,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,'2021-07-30 12:12:12','2021-07-31 08:03:41'),(261,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0.00,'25',NULL,'Understanding Bible Prophecies From The Old Testament','With so many things going on in this world today, we feel that the Bible has no connections at all in present time. This article will explain, and reveal to you that the Bible The Word Of The Living God, has more to do with our time, more than ever before. In the first three chapters of Genesis, it shows how Adam and Eve, were taken out of the Garden due to sin, and taken away from the Holy presence of God. The good news is that the book of Revelation has the keys that will unlock Heavens gates, and enter us Back into paradise, where we will be able to live with Jesus the Son of God, and the King of Kings Forever, and\n\nEver!\n\nHowever, a lot of us today do not understand the book of Revelations, and we then translate it into our own interpretation. 2 Peter 1:20 clearly says that “Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private\n\ninterpretation.”\n\nSo if it is not of private interpretation then how can I as an\n\nindividual understand Bible Prophecy?\n\n1. Before Opening The Bible always say a word of prayer, and ask the Lord to provide you with wisdom, and understanding. In James 1:5 it says that “If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, and it shall be given him.” So how do you know that you will be given the wisdom that you have prayed for? Numbers 23:19 says that “God is not a man, that he should lie.”\n\n2. Search the Scriptures. “Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.” John 5:39 In this scripture Jesus admonishes us to search the scriptures because the scriptures testify of Him Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God. The one that has died for our sins.\n\nTo understand the Prophecies of Revelation. We must first have a background. To obtain that background we must have knowledge of the Old Testament. There are a lot of people that says that the Old Testament has nothing to do with the New Testament. If you do not understand the Old Testament then you will never understand the New. There are 404 verses found in the book Of Revelation. Out of the 404 verses of the book, 278 verses refer to other stories, and prophecies in the Old Testament. The Old Testament is a platform for the first coming of Jesus. It sets the stage, and gives us examples of things\n\nthat would happen to Jesus when He comes, in the New Testament.\n\nIn the Old Testament we will review two stories, and then refer to them in the New Testament, and how they related to the Life of Jesus.\n\nFirst we will review the story of Joseph. Joseph was one of 12 brothers. (Gen. 37:9 &amp; Gen. 42:13) Joseph had his robe taken away from him; his brothers placed him into a pit where he did not have any food or water. Joseph was then sold for the price of slave.(Gen. 37:28) After he was sold, his brothers took his coat, and dipped it into blood.(Gen. 37:32) Even though Joseph went through this ordeal he still came out alive. What Joseph, and his brothers did not know was that God had a greater plan in store for them. God later used Joseph to save his family during the time of famine in the land of Egypt.\n\nNow we will review the Life of Jesus, in the New Testament, and\n\nsee how it relates to the story of Joseph in the Old Testament.\n\nJesus had 12 disciples. (Matt. 11:1) Judas sold Jesus for the price of a slave, or 30 pieces of silver. (Matt. 27:3) Once Jesus was in the hands of the Chief Priests and Pilate, He was beaten and his clothes were taken away from him, which was splattered with his own blood. (Matt. 27:31) Before Jesus died he prayed for those who crucified him, and said “Father Forgive them for they no not what they have done.” (Luke 23:32) God too had a plan for Jesus. He came to save the world from sin.\n\nHere in these two stories you will see that the prophecy was predicted in the life Of Joseph, and was fulfilled in the life Of Jesus Christ.\n\nSome similarities that are found here are:\n\n1. Both Joseph, and Jesus were sold as a slave.\n\n2. Both, had their garments taken away from them.\n\n3. Both forgave those who had sinned against them.\n\nThe Second Story that we will review is of Abraham, and Isaac. Isaac was a special child because Abraham’s wife Sarah could not have children, and in their old age God Blessed Abraham, and Sarah with a son, Isaac. (Gen. 21:3) God, testing Abraham’s faith, and told him to sacrifice his only son on the alter, as a burnt offering. (Gen. 22:2) Isaac, then carried the wood on his back for the alter. (Gen. 22:6) When they reached the mountain that the Lord had specified, Abraham, then made an alter, and tied Isaac to it. When he was ready to slay his son, he heard a Angels voice from heaven saying “Abraham, Abraham Do not lay a hand upon that lad, and do not do anything to him. (Gen.22: 9 – 12) With thanksgiving, and praise, Abraham, lifted his eyes, and saw a ram caught in a thicket by his horns. Abraham took the ram, and offered it up as a burnt offering instead of his son. (Gen. 22:13)\n\nNow we will compare the story of Abraham, and Isaac to the Story of Jesus, and God the Father. As Isaac had to carry the wood to the alter, so did Jesus carry wood, He carried the Cross. When Jesus died, he had a crown of thorns upon his head. (Matt. 27:29)\n\nThis story of Abraham, and Isaac is one of Importance. God knew that one day He too have to offer his Son as a sacrifice, a ransom, to pay for the price of sin. “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” John 3:16 I cannot even begin to imagine the pain that God the Father felt for his son dying on the cross. “But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.” Matt. 26:56\n\nAll I can say is what a loving God we serve! He looked beyond all selfishness, and gave his only son for the sins of mankind.\n\nSo as you can see here with the two examples, I have given, a knowledge of the Old Testament is needed to open the stories or keys of the New Testament. If you are trying to understand Bible Prophecy then you will need to have a background. If you want to understand what is going, on in the world today, and try to unlock Bible Prophecy, then you need to know the history of the bible from the Old Testament.\n\nI Pray that everyone that reads this article will be Blessed in the Name of Jesus!\n\nRemember That GLves You, And So Do I!',NULL,405,'4',0,0,0,'2021-07-30',NULL,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,'2021-07-30 12:25:39','2021-07-31 08:03:11'),(262,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0.00,'25',NULL,'My Prayer For Tonight','God.

We don’t decide our purpose. Our creator does.\n\nThink of a time in your life where you’ve designed something; anything. You designed it to accomplish something to have a set purpose. If you are a toy car, you can’t not like the way that you drove one day and decide to become a toy robot. Just like if you design a car: you designed it to be a car, and that’s what its purpose is. The car can’t just all of a sudden pull out of the garage one day and decide to be an airplane.\n\nFor me to say, whether you are Christian or not the purpose of your life is to Give Glory to God, which is extremely single-minded.

Doing the right thing or the wrong thing all starts with a decision. We think about things and thoughts are powerful but actions do not occur until we decide that they do. We make good decisions and bad decisions. Productive and unproductive ones. The great thing about it is we can take precautions to prevent making bad decisions.\n\nGreat decision-makers have great decision-makers as friends. They ask the advice of those who have been where they hope to be. It is similar to a person who is lost in a car they would be wise to ask someone for directions to where they are going. In the same way, if you do not know if you are making a good decision ask someone who can give you direction. If you want to be a positive person you should make a decision to have positive friends. They can give you positive advice and you can learn how to be a positive person from simply being around them. So hanging around positive people is a great precaution against being negative.\n\nYou must decide to be a positive person or you will be a negative one. Realize the power of your decisions. The madness of Hitler and Charles Manson began with the horrible decisions they made. Lance Armstrong beat cancer with divine intervention and the decision not to give up riding.

Guided meditation may utilize soothing photographs or scenarios to enhance the ability of the mind to relax and guide the body to a point of relaxation so that the person in meditation can find a true sense of inner peace. Quite often, guided meditation will be accompanied by soft music or sounds of nature.\n\nOne of the keys to successfully having a session of Guided meditation is finding an area where the one meditating will be free of distractions. Any outside interference will prevent proper concentration and make the attempts at guided meditation futile and perhaps even frustrating, further aggravating the problem seeking to be solved by the very use of guided meditation.\n\nAfter finding a suitable location for guided meditation, other factors need to be taken into consideration. Some practitioners of guided meditation feel that visual stimuli can be used to help achieve a sense of inner peace and help to achieve true relaxation. Still other practitioners of guided meditation feel that any outside visual simulation will detract from the mind’s ability to properly focus on the body and the results of the guided meditation will be hindered or even reversed.\n\nThe same can be said for audio stimulation during sessions of guided meditation. While some individuals believe that soothing sound effects or even quiet music is conducive to the guided meditation, still others believe that it is only a hindrance and will do nothing more than create a harmful atmosphere for the practitioner of such guided meditation.\n\nThe basic concept of guided meditation is to relax. This is done by taking oneself on a guided tour of sorts through their own body. In the practice of guided meditation, it is normal to find a focus point in the body and begin there, someplace that is easy to relax. While staying focused on the body and in particular the muscles, the practitioner of guided meditation attempts to relax the muscles of the body. Allowing the body to completely relax allows the practitioner of guided meditation to next completely relax the mind.\n\nWhen the mind and body are completely relaxed, the person can begin to concentrate on focusing his thoughts and ideas during the guided meditation. When using guided meditation, thoughts are usually thought to be transcendent and more in focus allowing the practitioner to perform better in all aspects of life.

Metaphysics recognizes that the mind is a field of energy and that whatever is physically manifested in life is also a field of energy.\n\nIn addition, metaphysics recognizes there is no separation of energy fields between the energy of the mind and all other energy fields that materialize in the physical universe.\n\nMetaphysics further recognizes the energy field of the mind can connect with other energy fields to alter or change the energy of already existing materializations. Metaphysics perceives that the mind on a surface level projects forth from itself into physical manifestation what it believes and focuses on over a period of time.

We want to express our sympathy, our sharing of their feelings, but we don’t know how to do it. Words can be comforting, but they’re also fleeting. So we turn to more tangible expressions of sympathy.\n\nSympathy gifts come in many forms. A card with a thoughtful message is often the first thing we seek. There is a surprising array of choices to be made when selecting a card. The natural inclination is often to pick a card that reflects the giver’s beliefs as opposed to focusing on those of the bereaved. Some sympathy cards contain short generic messages and are appropriate for acquaintances such as co-workers with whom one does not have a close personal relationship. Other cards reflect religious or spiritual themes, which may bring great comfort at such a difficult time. The final type of card emphasizes the friendship between the giver and receiver. These cards assure the receiver that a true friend will be ready to provide support in any way possible.\n\nWe shouldn’t underestimate the long-lasting impact a sympathy gift will have on the recipient. This point was driven home for me when I gave a plant to a co-worker. (It was spring and I was transplanting recently rooted baby spider plants to share with friends and acquaintances.) The next day she told me that she had cried when she brought it home and put it on her table.\n\nIt turned out that her father had died several years earlier. At that time, someone gave her a plant as a sympathy gift.

Pay attention to your breath, to the air moving in and out of your lungs and nose. Let the tension drain from your body.\n\nAsk the question in your mind, “Where am I?” Then ask, “What am I?” and “Who am I?” Just let these questions sit for a moment in your mind.\n\nBecome aware of your body, and consider your leg. Would you cease to exist if you lost it? Are you your leg? Continue through the parts of your body, asking of each part, “Am I here?” and “Is this what I am?”\n\nThen open your eyes and look around. Are you any of these things? You might feel pain when your favorite chair breaks, as though it were you, but you are not that chair. Which of these things you own are you? Ask these questions. Ask, “Am I this?”\n\nNow close your eyes again and say your name in your mind. Is there a sense of identity? And if you had no name? Ask yourself “Am I really…” and say your name again. Consider what the most honest answer is. Try saying “I am…” and insert any other name. Note how, when you call yourself by another name, you feel differently. You have a name-identity that is a collection of ideas, something seen differently by you and others.\n\nLet feelings arise, and ask “Am I this fear?… this pain, sadness, desire, pleasure, or anger? You can see that your feelings are not you – they just pass through you. Clothes, body, reputation – none of it is your true self-identity, is it?\n\nContinue this meditation for twenty minutes or so. Take a deep breath and get up, noticing if you feel different – maybe less worried or less attached to things, feelings and thoughts.

I am speaking of the chances we get every day to learn about ourselves. We can learn from the bad things that happen to us as well as the good things. I believe that everything and everyone can be a teacher. The Bible itself talks about how God works for the good of those who love Him in all things. I believe this. Mr. Kahlil Gibran talks about how we can learn kindness from the unkind and yet how we are ungrateful for this teacher. Yes, mean people can in fact teach us to be nicer. When we see how ugly mean words and actions look from a spiritual standpoint we can make a decision to be nice. No one wants to look ugly physically or spiritually.\n\nWhen I focus on learning rather than reacting I will make much better decisions. You see when I simply react, my decisions are based on my emotions rather than my intellect and spirituality. I have learned that when I respond in a mean manner to a mean person, it is like matching fire with fire. In these cases both people are likely to be burned. I can instead choose to match their fire of unkindness with the water of kindness. We all know that water puts out fire. It is up to me as to how I will respond.\n\nHow do you respond when you are challenged to be spiritual? Do you match meanness with meanness or kindness? hate with love or hate? If we take the time to learn and not react we will grow into the people the creator of the universe has called us to be. We can grow quite tall spiritually and eventually dwarf the demons of unkindness just by not responding in kind and learning how to deal with situations. The same situations will most likely repeat themselves.

Well, that is not true.\n\nIf one is not psychic, how does one clarify spiritual-based queries about oneself? There are 2 methods that I know of, namely Applied Kinesiology and Pendulum Reading.\n\nUsing Applied Kinesiology or Muscle testing, it is possible to ask our own body and the soul/mind questions and get ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ responses. Applied Kinesiology works by gauging the reaction of certain muscles after asking the intended question. A strong response from the muscle means a ‘Yes’, while a ‘No’ will elicit a weak reaction. Uncertainty to a question will also yield a ‘No’ or weak response.\n\nApplied Kinesiology can be performed alone or with the help of an assistant. One of the easiest ways to muscle test is to use the arms.\n\nFor clear and accurate answers, the session needs to start with a space clearing to remove any potential negative influences. Space clearing is the process of purging an area of negative and stagnant energies. It often involves defining boundaries and using smoke or smudging to clear the area. There are books and Internet websites that teach Applied Kinesiology as well as space and entity clearing.\n\nBesides Applied Kinesiology, Pendulum Reading is also a good alternative that does not require psychic ability. When used in conjunction with a YES/NO chart, the pendulum can be used to provide a Yes/No response to queries.\n\nIn addition, custom-made charts can also be tailored to very specific inquiries. For example, a degree or percentage chart can be used to indicate the degree of intensity.\n\nLike Applied Kinesiology, the pendulum reading session needs to start with the clearing of potentially negative influences for clear and accurate answers.\n\nWell, these are the tools for divination and spiritual inquiry that doesn’t need one to be psychic.

It was not exactly a chore as she was a very funny and interesting person.\n\nOn this particular day she started to talk about her health and explained to me that she was sure that she did not have long to live. She had a number of health problems as I am sure many people in their eighties do. These issues were gradually becoming worse and made her believe that the end was near. As it happens she was correct.\n\nI tried to convince her that she was wrong and that in fact she would live until she was a hundred. I advised her that I felt she should be more positive and to keep her chin up. She noticed that I was a little worried and told me not to panic and that she knew that she was heading for a better place.\n\nWhat are you on about? I asked. She continued that she knew for a fact that there was an after life and that she was actually looking forward to going there. She was not afraid of dying and had basically had enough of life, as she was always tired and had very little to look forward to.\n\nHow do you know that there is an after life? Do not be alarmed, Steve, she said. Your grandad comes and visits me every week and has told me all about it. I know it is hard for you to believe but it is true. When I die Steve, do not be too upset for too long. Be happy for me and be safe in the knowledge that we will meet up again in the future.\n\nMy nan died around six months later and I really hope that she has been able to once again meet up with my grandad and other people like her parents of course.\n\nHaving a belief in the after life gave my nan a piece of mind and something to look forward to. It also made her not have a fear of death.\n\nI have to admit that I know also believe in the after life, however I am in no rush to go there as yet. I have many more articles to write first!',NULL,156,'4',0,0,0,'2021-07-30',NULL,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,'2021-07-30 14:11:38','2021-07-31 07:44:43'),(276,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0.00,'25',NULL,'About Guru The Liberator','Life is a mystery. The cosmos is a mystery. What are its boundaries? If it is an expanding universe, where does it expand to? What is beyond it. Some of the stars are millions of light years away from us. What an unimaginable distance! What is there in the cosmos? Who made it? When did it form? What was there, before it was formed?\n\nWho are we? Am I a body with a name? Then how do some people have good luck and some bad? Why do some children get cancer at a very young age and some people with all the bad habits live a healthy life for a long time? What are we destined to do on this earth. Where did we come from and where shall we go?\n\nWhy there is so much misery in the world? Why do we love some people and hate some? What is that, which will satisfy us? What is the objective of human life? There are so many questions in our minds. Every religion has its own theory and its own explanation. In India, it is considered that The Guru is the only one who can answer all these questions.\n\nWho is Guru? According to Indian scriptures, Guru is God in human body. He comes on this earth to liberate followers. A Guru is not to be confused with people who write well or speak well about Indian mythology and philosophy. They might be called as learned persons or good speakers or good writers of books. But none of them is The Guru.\n\nThe west is getting attracted to Hinduism. Many branches of Hinduism including Yoga are becoming very popular in the west. Many people travel from India to the west to lecture upon Hinduism and scriptures of India, and many people call them as Gurus. That is wrong use of word Guru. Guru is very mysterious.\n\nHow to know that some one is Guru? After coming in contact with Guru, you must feel a change that is life altering. The change is not something like – I feel good, or I feel peaceful. But Guru brings about changes that can never be explained by you to others. If anytime, you come across Guru, you will know by these changes and then over a period of time The Guru will reveal his/her identity to you. That depends on his/her wish.\n\nNo one should take every saint in India as Guru. There are very few in the world. According to Indian scriptures, only if you have collected lot of good karma, do you get Guru. I can only make one statement. The experience of the power of Guru is very different than anything else. And in the beginning the experience may be very painful rather than pleasant. But the end is pure bliss.',NULL,167,'4',0,0,0,'2021-07-30',NULL,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,'2021-07-30 14:15:16','2021-07-31 08:05:40'),(277,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.00,NULL,NULL,'1627078348781-voicemaker.in-speech',NULL,NULL,197,'4',0,0,0,NULL,NULL,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,'2021-08-02 01:37:55','2021-08-02 01:37:55'),(278,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.00,NULL,NULL,'The Law That Holds All Matter Together',NULL,NULL,353,'4',0,0,0,NULL,NULL,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,'2021-09-25 15:34:50','2021-09-25 15:34:51');
